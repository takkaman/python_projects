China to Unleash $108 Billion in Reserve Cut for Some Banks,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-24/china-s-central-bank-cuts-reserve-ratio-for-some-banks,2018-06-24T09:15:31.229Z,"['\n                Of the total, 500 billion yuan is for debt-equity swaps\n            ', '\n                200 billion yuan is for smaller banks to lend to small firms\n            ']","China's central bank will cut the amount of cash some lenders must hold as reserves, unlocking about 700 billion yuan ($108 billion) of liquidity, as it seeks to control leverage and support smaller companies.The required reserve ratio for some banks will drop by 0.5 percentage point, effective July 5, the People's Bank of China said on its website. That's the day before the U.S. and China are scheduled to impose tariffs on each other.Such a reduction had been widely expected, especially after China's cabinet said on Wednesday that it would use monetary policy tools, including cutting reserve ratios for some banks, to boost credit supply to smaller companies. Sunday's cut probably won't be the last. Analysts expect the bank to further ease policy going forward to help cope with a slowing economy and offset the effects of a crackdown on shadow banking.""While the PBOC reiterated its neutral stance, we think that the move is one step further toward more accommodative monetary policy, which is only fitting given softening growth and mounting trade tensions,"" Wei Yao, China economist at Societe Generale SA in Paris, wrote in a note. She expects further cuts in the reserve rate ratios, lower rates on liquidity instruments and a lower interest rate corridor in the second half of the year.The yuan continued to slide on Monday. The benchmark Shanghai stock index is on the brink of a bear market after tumbling almost 20 percent from its recent high, and closed Monday down 1.1 percent.The aim is to support small and micro enterprises, and to further promote the debt-to-equity swap program, according to the central bank. The cut will apply to major state-run commercial banks, joint-stock commercial lenders, postal banks, city commercial lenders, rural banks and foreign banks.The PBOC designed the cut to do two different things, according to the statement. The 500 billion yuan unlocked for the nation's five biggest state-run banks and 12 joint-stock commercial lenders will be channeled to debt-to-equity swaps, which can reduce companies' debt burdens and help cleaning up banks' balance sheets. The 200 billion yuan freed for smaller lenders such as the postal bank and city commercial lenders will be used to support funding for smaller businesses.The PBOC announced more details on how it will boost credit for small companies on Monday. It will add another 150 billion yuan in its targeted relending quota, a scheme in which banks can obtain relatively cheap funding from the PBOC to loan out to small companies and rural businesses. The interest rate for SME relending loans will be lowered by 0.5 percentage point, the central bank said in a statement.By requesting banks use the liquidity to support-debt-to-equity swaps, the PBOC has broadened the scope of its targeted RRR reductions. While two previous cuts were aimed at helping smaller firms, the main beneficiaries of the debt-to-equity swaps will be larger companies in traditional industries like coal, iron and other metals, according to Wen Bin, a researcher at China Minsheng Banking Corp. in Beijing. Many of those are state-owned enterprises.The swap program was introduced in 2016 to assist highly-leveraged companies by encouraging banks and private investors to replace their claims on loans with equity holdings. It's seen little progress - 102 companies had signed up for swaps worth about 1.6 trillion yuan by the end of 2017, but only around 20 percent of those had been executed, according to China International Capital Corporation.The move will ""help push forward the steady progress of structural deleveraging, and strengthen support to the weak links of small-and-micro businesses. It is a targeted and precise fine-tuning,"" the central bank said in a separate statement. ""The PBOC will keep implementing prudent and neutral monetary policy, and create a favorable monetary and financial environment for high-quality development and supply-side reform.""The funds unlocked from the reserve ratio cut shouldn't be used to support so-called zombie companies, the PBOC said.The central bank's support of debt-to-equity ""may reflect its intent to contain credit risk and prevent a significant impact on domestic business confidence,"" Morgan Stanley economists led by China Chief Economist Robin Xing wrote in a note. The next steps could include open market cash injections and further RRR cuts, Xing wrote.The central bank is adjusting monetary policy at a time when China's economy is showing signs of slowing amid an ongoing campaign to clean up the financial sector and worsening trade tensions with the U.S. The change will also help ease a funding squeeze for lenders, which have to repay money borrowed from the central bank's medium-term lending facility, and put aside cash for both the July tax season and upcoming quarterly regulatory checks.One-month interbank borrowing costs, or Shibor, climbed to the highest level since early April last week, as liquidity tightens before the regulatory and tax season.¡°The size of the liquidity being unleashed has beat expectations and it's larger than the previous two cuts this year¡±, said Ming Ming, head of fixed-income research at Citic Securities Co. in Beijing. ¡°It's almost a universal cut as it covers almost all lenders.¡±The move will ease liquidity shortages currently seen in the implementation of debt-to-equity programs, and it shows that policy makers still don't want to send a signal of across-the-board easing, Ming said. ""The central bank may have predicted rising debt risks in the near future, so it decided to set up such an arrangement,"" he said.¡ª With assistance by Yinan Zhao, Xiaoqing Pi, Tian Chen, Miao Han, and Amanda Wang"
"Hated by Many, Distressed Debt Brawler Isn't About to Back Down",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-04/hated-by-many-distressed-debt-brawler-isn-t-about-to-back-down,2018-06-04T09:00:00.003Z,"['\n                Mark Brodsky made his name suing companies over unpaid debts\n            ', '\n                Aurelius is known for novel legal theories, aggressive tactics\n            ']","Mark Brodsky knows the nasty things the haters say about him. Things like he's a bully. An extortionist. A hedge-fund vulture.But suggest that he's litigious, and his eyes widen.¡°If anyone calls us litigious, it's name-calling,¡± says the lawyer-turned-distressed debt investor, who has spent two decades suing cash-strapped corporations and, on one occasion, an entire country over unpaid debts.But Wall Street isn't about sticks and stones. It's about money.And in a business with no shortage of sharp elbows, Brodsky has some of the sharpest -- and he's pretty good with them, too. Using novel legal theories and targeting gray areas in the law, he honed his investing approach in distressed debt working for a master, Elliott Management's Paul Singer, and then took it to new heights at his own $3.4 billion firm, Aurelius Capital Management.Critics don't mince words.¡°I started fighting tooth and nail with Mr. Brodsky when that self-absorbed jerk began his career working for Paul Singer,¡± says William Brandt, who once butted heads with Brodsky as a trustee in a bankruptcy case. Brandt ¡°firmly believes¡± he's made his career on intimidation.The nicest words Brandt can muster: ¡°Many think of Aurelius as a suppository for the distressed industry.¡±Brodsky, told of the barb, says he doesn't know what to make of it.Others have accused his New York-based firm of trying to ¡°weaponize¡± bankruptcy law and to ¡°extort value¡± from its financial positions. During an ugly, drawn-out legal battle against Argentina, Aurelius and Elliott were called financial terrorists by its president. And more recently, in Puerto Rico's debt crisis, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders lambasted hedge-fund creditors like Aurelius for being ¡°morally reprehensible.¡±¡°Mark can be a formidable opponent -- I'd rather be in the trenches with him than on the other side,¡± said Jay Newman, a former money manager at Elliott who brought on Brodsky to work at the firm. ¡°His tenacity is never mindless, it's based on hard work.¡±Love them or hate them, distressed debt investors, who buy up assets of troubled companies, have always helped make the markets go 'round. Brodsky, 64, says operations like Aurelius ¡°do a lot of constructive things¡± and get a bad rap for pushing borrowers to reorganize and restructure.Annual returns since Aurelius&apos;s inceptionSource: People with knowledge of the matter; Hedge Fund ResearchNote: 2018 returns through AprilThe strategy has generally worked out pretty well for Aurelius's clients. Since the firm's inception in 2006, its flagship fund has generated annualized returns of 7.4 percent, versus 4.9 percent for your average distressed debt fund. This year, Aurelius has made 6.5 percent through April, compared with a 1 percent gain for its peers.Brodsky works hard to avoid the limelight. He refuses to be photographed or discuss his personal life. Search for a picture of him online, and you'll find instead ones of Sam Zell, the real estate magnate known as the Grave Dancer -- a happenstance Brodsky's in no particular rush to correct.Leaning back in his chair in his midtown Manhattan office, Brodsky hardly comes across like a financial brawler.A trim, bespectacled man with a high forehead and silvery hair, he speaks in lawyerly sub-clauses and methodical play-by-plays. He offers visitors a water glass engraved midway up with a slogan he says explains how debt investors see the world: ¡°Pessimist's Glass: This glass is now half empty.¡±Aurelius?Capital bobble-head dollBrodsky wants to get something straight. He scoffs at the idea other hedge funds are afraid to go up against Aurelius, named after his intellectual idol, the Roman philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius. A bobble-head doll of the old stoic sits atop his desk.¡°I wish we could just show up, wave a flag, and everybody caves!¡± he says with a rare laugh.Yet over the years, he's developed a reputation for being a ruthless and indefatigable opponent who's willing to make big, bold bets in distressed debt. Brodsky has a formidable track record pursuing ¡°litigation plays,¡± and taking on the likes of General Motors, Argentina and Puerto Rico in court. And while historically low defaults have led others in the industry, like Singer himself, to branch out, Brodsky has stuck to what he knows best. He says he knows his limits and avoids ¡°boredom trades¡± that tend to get others into trouble.Brodsky never intended to become one of the most-feared distressed debt investors on Wall Street. A Harvard-trained lawyer, he says his first stint in finance -- at Dickstein Partners, a distressed debt hedge fund that later shuttered -- left a bad taste in his mouth. The trade-by-the-seat-of-your-pants ethos clashed with his methodical, analytical nature.Then in 1996, he joined Elliott. Brodsky said he valued the mathematical approach of Singer's firm, which specialized in a deep-research style of investing. It was also where he made his first profitable trade: in the distressed debt of Southeast Banking Corp., a bankrupt Miami-based bank.To hear Brodsky tell it, he combed through reams of documents from a Freedom of Information Act request (made in the days before it was an easy, routine thing on the Internet) and discovered the bank was actually solvent.The problem was the trustee -- the aforementioned William Brandt -- who was just ¡°sitting on the cash.¡± When Brandt refused to distribute it to creditors, Brodsky successfully had the court replace him and the money disbursed.¡°The trustee didn't like me,¡± he said.Brandt recalls it differently. He says he subpoenaed Brodsky for the documents and asked the court to sanction him for failing to produce them. Brandt believes Brodsky pursued his own interests at the expense of other creditors. Whatever the case, Elliott got what it wanted, and Brodsky would end up spending almost a decade there working under Singer.¡°Having someone as capable as Paul above you -- there was a real safety net in that,¡± Brodsky said, ¡°It was arguably insane to leave.¡±In 2006, he decided to set off on his own. Brodsky scraped together $330 million for his firm and settled on the Aurelius name after spotting a new translation of the stoic's ¡°Meditations¡± at a local bookstore. He says he was struck by how the all-powerful emperor believed that ¡°no matter who you are, you have to act honorably.¡±¡°It was a splendid metaphor for how I wanted to be seen on Wall Street.¡±But ask his critics, and they'll say those high-minded ideals didn't always necessarily extend to those in his crosshairs. In Argentina, one of Brodsky's biggest wins, Aurelius drew the ire of an entire nation. The decade-long legal battle got ugly at times, with holdout creditors going so far as to seize an Argentine naval ship in Ghana to pressure the country into paying what it owed. The government in turn created video games and cartoons to teach children about the dangers of vulture investors.Of course, Singer got most of the press, but Brodsky made his mark as an astute and resourceful operator among Wall Street insiders. Back-of-the-envelope math puts Brodsky's returns on the investment, which people familiar with the matter say he built between 2007 and 2010, at about 700 percent, based on the bonds' average price over that period.¡°Mark is never just along for the ride,¡± said Newman, who was Elliott's point man on Argentina and retired shortly after the country settled with the hedge funds in 2016. ¡°He always thinks things through, does his own homework.¡±Jon Harari, an Aurelius alum, says Brodsky's intensely cerebral nature made conversations less than easy. Harari recalls ¡°spending hours thinking of how to say a certain thing¡± because Brodsky wanted people to quickly boil things down to their most salient points, regardless of how complex. Brodsky, it seemed, was always 10 steps ahead anyway.That's not to suggest Brodsky is afraid to speak his mind. Over the years, he's developed a penchant for firing off cutting and sarcastic missives, excoriating those who don't see it his way.In 2015, Brodsky compared Axel Kicillof, Argentina's economy minister at the time, to Nero fiddling while Rome burned. A year later, he wrote to an administrator of Brazilian phone carrier Oi SA, ¡°Respectfully, we believe you are utterly failing to discharge your most fundamental responsibilities...you have come up with one bewildering excuse after another to procrastinate.¡±He's shown a talent for playing hardball at the negotiating table, too.During talks with GM, lawyers for its Canada unit claimed the subsidiary had little value and threatened to file for bankruptcy, leaving hedge-fund creditors with nothing. Brodsky called their bluff, brazenly throwing his wallet on the table and offering to buy the unit for whatever was in the wallet, according to court testimony. Then, by leveraging an obscure provision in Nova Scotia law, the hedge-fund group ultimately walked away with a settlement worth almost twice the returns of other creditors.Bruce Zirinsky, a lawyer who represented Aurelius in GM and other cases, calls Brodsky ¡°one of the brightest and nicest people in the business.¡±?Others, he says, are just ¡°lemmings.¡±Nevertheless, as Aurelius's profile has grown, so has scrutiny of its tactics.In 2016, a judge said demands made by a group of creditors in Sabine Oil & Gas, which included Aurelius, had taken an ¡°enormous toll,¡± citing a long trial over a claim that was eventually shown to be fruitless. Oi's bankruptcy judge ruled that Aurelius tried to ¡°weaponize¡± the law. (The judge ultimately said the firm hadn't ¡°demonstrated bad faith.¡±)Brodsky, who counts pension funds and foundations among his firm's investors, stands by his positions, however unpopular. It's a matter of doing your homework and picking the right battles.In Puerto Rico, the humanitarian crisis caused by Hurricane Maria -- from power outages to lack of clean water and shortages of food and medicine -- has made it harder to argue that bondholders like Aurelius should get priority in a record-setting $74 billion bankruptcy.Brodsky sympathizes with the local population -- to a point. He believes the lasting effects of the hurricane will be ¡°modest.¡± Bondholders, rather than being the problem, are part of the solution to Puerto Rico's financial mess. If anything, Aurelius's interests are more aligned with the territory's people than other involved parties -- like the government and local officials, he said.Asked if he thinks his legal claims on the U.S. territory's debt are worth fighting for when it pits him against people struggling to get back on their feet, Brodsky says the thought hasn't occurred to him.¡°I'm paid to make money for my investors,¡± he says, ¡°not lose it.¡±"
Italy Turns to Postal Police to Fight Fake News,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-07/who-you-gonna-call-postal-police-is-italy-s-fake-news-fix,2018-06-07T09:53:02.118Z,"[""\n                Postal Police's tasks range from fake stamps to fake news\n            "", '\n                Rest of EU has opted for new laws, as U.S. weighs regulation\n            ']","Italy's leaning on crime fighters of yesteryear in its battle against fake news: the postal police.As misinformation campaigns roil electoral processes, from the U.S. 2016 presidential race and the U.K.'s Brexit referendum to Italy's March general elections, governments around the world are struggling to block the onslaught of fake news.France's effort to address the issue with new legislation -- its anti-fake news bill lands in parliament Thursday -- is already raising questions about whether it's the best answer to a complicated problem.Italy, for its part, is going down a different route, mixing the new with the old. The country is calling on its once-outdated Polizia Postale, or postal police, to stop the spread of unfounded reports on the web.Created in 1981 and based in Rome, the postal police originally guarded post offices and supplied armed escorts for cash-in-transit vans as well as fighting cyber-crime of all sorts. Today it counts about 2,000 members, each working within the Italian police force and dividing their time between cybersecurity operations and more traditional legal matters.It still investigates fake postage stamps and related fraud, but its forces in locations across Italy have expanded their expertise to the web, catching pedophilia, hacking, money-laundering, credit-card fraud, copyright violations by monitoring other platforms.The postal police now regularly issues warnings on its website to users about false news reports. It became extra active ahead of Italy's March 4 election, when it launched a ¡°red button¡± on its website for people to denounce fake claims.Fabricated election polls and false reports about local incidents, often involving immigrants and other minorities, were among the fakes that plagued Italy over the past year. Several news outlets in November reported that an underage Muslim girl had been assaulted by her much older husband in the city of Padua, and was in hospital -- a story that made the rounds on social media and was shared by the likes of politician Matteo Salvini, before being later denied by the police.The then-interior minister, Marco Minniti, described the types of reports that would be flagged as ¡°news which is clearly baseless¡±. ¡°The police doesn't take part in the political debate,¡± he said.But Italy's efforts to utilize the old guard, or France's decision to create news laws, may not please Europe at large. The region has coordinated on privacy protection, such as with the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation, but member nations have so far gone their own way to fight fake news.¡°There have been several legislative initiatives to stop the spread of false information since the beginning of the 19th century,¡± either because those fakes could impact merchandise prices or politics, said Nathalie Mallet-Poujol, a member of the Montpellier University law faculty and a director of research at French public laboratory CNRS. ¡°With the black hole that is the Internet, these old debates are taking on a whole other dimension.¡±¡ª With assistance by Chiara Albanese"
$210 Billion of Indian Bad Debt Lures Funds Seeking Returns,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-04/india-s-210-billion-bad-debt-lures-funds-hunting-for-returns,2018-06-04T01:11:30.494Z,"['\n                CDPQ, SSG among foreign funds buying local distressed assets\n            ', '\n                Foreign investors see the fledgling market as big opportunity\n            ']","India's two-year-old bankruptcy law, which gives creditors more power to restructure troubled companies, is luring more and more offshore investors from as far as Canada to buy the nation's bad debt.Caisse de d¨¦p?t et placement du Qu¨¦bec, a Canadian pension fund manager, has made $600 million available to Edelweiss Group for investment in local distressed assets, according to R.K. Bansal, an adviser for Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Co. Hong Kong-based SSG Capital Management Ltd. sees more opportunities in such assets, and foreign funds including Oaktree Capital Group LLC and Varde Partners are also keen to participate in the fledgling market.India's banking sector is coping with about $210 billion of soured or problem loans, a legacy of a borrowing spree following the global financial crisis and an economic slowdown after that. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code introduced in 2016 has given rise to opportunities for funds to acquire borrowers' distressed assets. High potential profits on those deals attract funds: SC Lowy Financial HK Ltd. expects annualized returns of about 15 percent, according to Chief Investment Officer Soo Cheon Lee.¡°The change now is that there is more bad debt available to buy as many more names are in restructuring,¡± said Pallavi Gopinath Aney, a principal in the finance and projects team at Baker McKenzie Wong & Leow in Singapore. Foreign funds see significant value in problem assets and ¡°are willing to bring in management and expertise to run the distressed companies,¡± she said.See also: QuickTake on how India's bankruptcy law may boost M&ASSG Capital Management, which oversees more than $4 billion, has deployed a ¡°significant amount of capital¡± in India, said the fund's Chief Investment Officer Edwin Wong without elaborating. Its outlook on the nation remains positive, he said.Sales of distressed assets from banks to third-party investors jumped in the year ended March 31, according to Jamie Tadelis, co-head of sales at SC Lowy Financial in Hong Kong. ¡°We have seen an increase in fund managers pivoting their efforts from other jurisdictions towards India,¡± he said.The Hong Kong-based loan and bond trading firm sees India as its main market for distressed debt in Asia, SC Lowy's Lee said in an interview in March. As a foreign financial firm, it is easier to do business in India than in China, where local partnerships are usually required, Lee said.The introduction of the bankruptcy law has brought the benefit of debt resolutions with deadlines for foreign funds, said Aney at Baker McKenzie Wong & Leow.India's lenders are seeking to resolve about 40 of the largest troubled accounts with an outstanding debt of more than 4 trillion rupees ($60 billion) this year, in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's push to get rid of bad loans. An Indian court provided a temporary relief to the nation's cash-strapped power companies by asking officials in the finance, coal, power and oil ministries and a bankruptcy panel to meet in June to possibly resolve the issue of some stressed power assets.The bad debt resolutions are already starting to spark mergers and acquisitions.Tata Steel Ltd. last month said it had completed the acquisition of a controlling stake in Bhushan Steel Ltd. after debt resolution under India's insolvency law.

But a three-decade spread hasn't been so kind to Libya and Venezuela.A generation gap in this case isn't how different children are from their parents. Instead, Bloomberg analyzed per-capita incomes in 1990 and forecasts for 2020 in more than 150 nations, and measured how much they moved up or down in the world rankings.Equatorial Guinea, the only African nation where Spanish is an official language, is projected to rank 45th in terms of per-capita gross domestic product in 2020, compared to 146th in 1990. That surge of more than 100 places is mainly thanks to the discovery of oil. China will have the second-biggest jump, rising 66 places to rank 62rd in 2020, based on International Monetary Fund data compiled by Bloomberg.The latest generation hasn't been so kind to oil-rich Libya and Venezuela, though. War and political turmoil have sapped the flow of energy, leaving those nations far worse economically than they were three decades ago. A generation ago, Libya ranked 24th in the world. It's projected at 85th in 2020.""GDP per capita is very geared to how big the capitalist sector is compared to the government sector"" Steve Hanke, professor of applied economics and co-director of the Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise at Johns Hopkins University, said in an interview. ""Very dramatic movements in prosperity (GDP per capita) can occur over time.""Using per-capita GDP to define the economic health of nations doesn't necessarily reflect quality of life for the average person, as calculations don't take into account the proportion of wealth going into the pockets of the elite compared to the masses. In Equatorial Guinea, which has 1.2 million people, vast macro gains mask how little money is trickling down to the lower tier. As much as 77 percent of its population lives in poverty, according to the latest available data on the country.That's less the case in China. The world's most-populous nation also had the most billionaires of any country, according to the Hurun Global Rich List 2018. About 10 percent of the world's population, or roughly 800 million people, have been raised above the poverty line since China introduced reforms in 1978 to embrace the market economy.In Poland, which elected the first non-communist prime minister in the Eastern Bloc in late 1989, transitioned well to a capitalism in the past three decades. While Poland's population actually shrank since 1990, its ranking jumped 22 spots.""Nobody was as well prepared as Poland from an institutional perspective to jump into the market system"" said Professor Greg Kolodko, former minister of finance and deputy prime minister of Poland, said in emailed comments.Among developed economies, countries plagued by high debt have fallen the most. Italy is forecast to fall to 34th in 2020 from 18th. Greece is seen dropping 10 spots to 44rd, while a series of ¡°lost decades¡± and an aging society will push Japan down nine places to 29th.Among the rest of the world's seven most industrialized economies, only the U.K. rose, albeit a single spot, the same level the U.S. fell.Six of the wealthiest economies in 1990 forecast to see per capita income drop in one generation.Source: Bloomberg analysis of IMF WEO April&apos;2018 dataNote: Ranking based on  purchasing power parity adjusted GDP per capita (in current international dollar terms);  Comparisons excluded economies with data missing in either or both of the two referenced years"

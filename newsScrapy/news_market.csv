High-Flying Toronto Condo Market May Be About to Hit Turbulence,"The chill that has crept over some segments of the Toronto housing market may soon extend to one of its persistent hot spots: condominiums.Evidence of a slowdown is emerging as new rules make it tougher to get a mortgage and borrowing costs rise for the first time in almost a decade. That¡¯s reducing the appeal of Toronto condos, whose average price now exceeds C$560,000 ($420,000). Projects are taking longer to sell and, in some areas, developers are using incentives to move units.¡°There are cash incentives being offered, discount parking being offered,¡± Robert Gidwani, a broker at REsource Realty, said by phone from Toronto. ¡°We¡¯ve seen a bit more incentives especially in the resale market, we are seeing fewer multiple offers coming in.¡±Christopher Bibby, a broker at RE/MAX Hallmark Bibby Group Realty, said demand is still ¡°extremely active¡± for condos with ¡°wow factor,¡± such as a one-bedroom unit near Bloor St. with unobstructed views of the water that sold for the list price of C$629,900 in less than 48 hours.But more generic inventory is taking longer to sell. ¡°You¡¯re not seeing the same pace of growth or aggressiveness on the buyer side,¡± he said.The question is whether condos will join the slump in the single-family home segment, signaling a broader correction in the Canadian housing market, a risk policymakers have flagged for several years but which has so far failed to materialize. Condos accounted for 30 percent of total Toronto sales in May.Condo benchmark price gain slips in past year Source: Toronto Real Estate Board Prices for each month are on a yearly basisSome developers are starting to give buyers longer than the usual six months to come up with a down payment, which usually ranges from 15 to 25 percent. ¡°That really increases the affordability level for people who are saving and paying as they go,¡± said Gidwani.Shaun Hildebrand at condo data provider Urbanation Inc. said high prices and buyer fatigue, particularly from investors, are coming into play. ¡°Relative to last year when new projects would sell out almost immediately after launching, absorptions have moderated to more historically normal levels this year,¡± he said.Read More: Sticker Shock Hits New Yorker Hunting for Toronto ApartmentUnlike prices for detached homes, which are down almost 10 percent from the peak last year, condo prices have continued to climb, reaching a record in May. But the pace of appreciation has slowed. On a year-over-year basis, the 8.3 percent increase in May¡¯s benchmark condo price was the smallest in almost two years while sales fell 16 percent from the same month the year before.Models of Frank Gehry¡¯s project in Toronto.At the same time, supply is rising. The federal housing agency said work began on 7,691 units in the first quarter, the most since at least 1990. Urbanation predicts starts could hit records for the next two or three years, as high-profile developments come on line such as the development designed by Frank Gehry which will include the country¡¯s tallest residential tower at 92 stories.It¡¯s a trend that could make condos less appealing to investors. ¡°With the increase in completions that we¡¯re expecting and the slowdown in price appreciation, it may not be as attractive to hold over the longer term,¡± Hildebrand said in a telephone interview. ¡°In that regard, you can start to see investors selling.¡±At the same time, carrying costs -- mortgage payments, property taxes and maintenance fees -- increasingly exceed rental income. That negative monthly cash flow reached C$424 on average for resale condos in the first quarter of 2017, according to an April report by brokerage Realosophy, citing Urbanation data. Many investors buy pre-construction, wait five years for the project to get built and rents to appreciate to get positive cash flow.Many investors will accept negative cash flow as long as they see price gains on the underlying asset. However sustaining the recent pace of price gains over the longer term may be difficult, the Bank of Canada said in a report this month. ¡°If expectations reverse and prices recede, speculators may quickly sell their assets, which could lead to large, rapid price declines.¡±¡°When you look at it as an investor, the economics are not there to buy and hold a condo based on cash flow,¡± Robert Kavcic, senior economist at Bank of Montreal, said by phone from Toronto. ¡°Now you absolutely do need price gains to make the economics work.¡±Prices are unlikely to drop anytime soon, said Hildebrand at Urbanation, citing the low inventory of unsold units so far. However, ¡°investors should be expecting a lower rate of return than they have in the past.¡±Builders may begin scaling back plans in the face of a slowdown. ¡°Developers are being careful in introducing new projects as construction costs have been rising quickly, land is scarce and expensive, development charges are doubling, and there is heightened uncertainty regarding approvals under the new planning regime,¡± he said. ¡°That will help keep inventory levels in check and price levels steady.¡±Still, any weakness in condos would affect the larger housing market, which has seen a sales drop in the past few months and flat price gains on an annualized basis, the Teranet¨CNational Bank House Price Index shows.Eric Lascelles at RBC Global Asset Management, Canada¡¯s biggest asset manager, says anecdotal evidence of slowing demand for condos is one reason he¡¯s less optimistic about the housing market, which he says is in the middle of a ¡°sea change.¡±Lascelles, who helps manage $330 billion, sees a 30 percent chance of a ¡°serious correction,¡± where prices nationally fall by a fifth, and more in the hottest markets. His base case, to which he assigns a 50 percent chance, is that the market just goes sideways. ¡°We¡¯re seeing an inflection here and we need to figure out if this is just a blip or something bigger,¡± he said.¡ª With assistance by Erik Hertzberg"
"U.S., Canada, Mexico Unite Long Enough to Win 2026 World Cup Bid","The World Cup is coming back to America.Nations at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow backed North America¡¯s joint bid to host the 2026 World Cup. With a handful of games in Mexico and Canada but the majority in the U.S., the 2026 bid promises the richest and most lucrative tournament in the history of global soccer.FIFA president Gianni Infantino on June 13.The expanded 2026 men¡¯s event, featuring 48 teams for the first time, will be played in 16 different cities -- 10 in the U.S., plus three sites in both Canada and Mexico. The U.S. will host 60 of the 80 matches, including the final, scheduled for MetLife Stadium outside New York City.¡°It¡¯s a bit emotional for us today,¡± Carlos Cordeiro, president of U.S. Soccer, said after the vote. ¡°The beautiful game transcends borders and cultures. Football today is the only victor, and in that spirit, we wish our Russian hosts and all the teams participating here this month, the very best of luck.¡±The winning bid got 134 votes, compared to 65 for Morocco. There was one abstention.Read more: A QuickTake on the World Cup¡¯s Corruption ScandalsWednesday¡¯s vote, held in Moscow on the eve of this year¡¯s tournament, was about much more than just the 2026 host nation. Many in the international community viewed this decision as a reflection of how far FIFA has come after years of scandal and widespread corruption, some of which was tied to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding processes.When Gianni Infantino replaced embattled Joseph ¡°Sepp¡± Blatter as president of soccer¡¯s governing body in 2016, he acknowledged that the organization was ¡°in a crisis¡± and promised reforms.The 2026 award is also a victory for many of FIFA¡¯s corporate partners, which will have the advantage of more teams and the world¡¯s biggest media market. That includes Adidas AG, Dalian Wanda Group, and Coca-Cola Co., as well as NBCUniversal¡¯s Telemundo and 21st Century Fox Inc., which have already secured the U.S. Spanish- and English-language broadcasts.On paper, it was hard to make the case for Morocco. Canada, Mexico and the U.S. are home to a combined 491 million people and two of the world¡¯s biggest media markets. All of the proposed stadiums exist already. And perhaps most persuasive, the North American bid promised FIFA a record $11 billion in profit, nearly double the $6.6 billion that governing body expects to earn in the 2022 event in Qatar and more than double the $5 billion estimated by Morocco.But these votes are often about much more than stadiums, infrastructure and even profit.Every one of FIFA¡¯s 200-plus members holds a single vote, and regions tend to vote in blocks. That means the 31-member Caribbean federation has three times the voting power of South America, which includes soccer powers Brazil and Argentina.Large votes are often swayed by small concessions promised to the right number of smaller nations or by regional biases. Morocco¡¯s bid, for example, received vocal support from France and a large contingent of Middle Eastern and North African nations. In a tweet in April, President Donald Trump questioned why the U.S. should ¡°be supporting these countries when they don¡¯t support us (including at the United Nations)?¡±Eight years ago, the U.S. was in a similar position, when it bid for the 2022 tournament. Competing against South Korea, Japan, Australia and Qatar, the U.S. seemed like the obvious choice given its existing stadiums and geo-political standing. Former president Bill Clinton and other celebrities spent nearly two years campaigning and the U.S. still lost to Qatar.The event has since been moved to November to avoid Qatar¡¯s blistering summer temperatures, bribery accusations abound, and potential human rights violations at the stadium sites have caused outrage from the international community.The money promised by the North American bid will be a strong boost to FIFA. The Switzerland-based organization reports its revenue in four-year cycles, and most recently claimed $5.7 billion for the cycle culminating in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.The tumultuous last four years, plus the controversy over Russia, has made the 2015-18 cycle a ¡°tougher sell,¡± according to Nielsen, and the next four years leading up to the Qatar event might be equally rough. Citing a number of high-profile sponsors dropping FIFA, London newspaper The Independent reported that FIFA¡¯s 2018 World Cup sponsorship revenues were down $240 million.On Wednesday Trump tweeted his congratulations, saying the winning bid was the result of ¡°a great deal of hard work.¡±The U.S. last hosted the World Cup in 1994, an event that eventually gave rise to Major League Soccer, now in its 23rd season. The 3.6 million attendees remain a World Cup record, despite the fact that only 24 nations competed at the time. Mexico hosted the World Cup in 1986; Canada never has.¡°The fact that Mexico, Canada and the U.S. can come together and organize the world¡¯s biggest sporting event is a nice message,¡± FIFA head Infantino said at a press conference. ¡°And that¡¯s something we have to be happy for.¡±Typically, the host nation gets an automatic berth in the World Cup but Infantino said the regional soccer federation, Concacaf, must whether to use its slots for all three squads. The region has 7 slots, 6 automatic and then two ¡°halfs¡± that allow teams to qualify through a playoff.Mexico has played in every World Cup since 1990. Canada qualified once, in 1986. The U.S. team failed to qualify this year.¡ª With assistance by Ira Boudway, and Jake Rudnitsky"
"Five Fed Mysteries, Korean Chasm, Argentina Sits at 40%: Eco Day","Welcome to Wednesday, Asia. Here¡¯s news from Bloomberg Economics to help get your day started:"
"Sliding Emerging Markets Bear Brunt of Angst Over Trade, OPEC","Emerging markets were getting little relief as the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China hurt most major currencies and sent stocks to their lowest level since December.An index of currencies was set for a fifth day of losses on Monday, led by the South Korean won and Russia¡¯s ruble, leaving it on track for the biggest quarterly decline since September 2015. Yield spreads on emerging-market sovereign bonds widened four basis points relative to U.S. Treasuries, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. index showed.Equities extended their worst weekly performance in a month, with the MSCI index of emerging-market stocks retreating for a fourth day. Outflows from U.S.-listed emerging market exchange-traded funds totaled $2.7 billion in the week ended June 15, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the biggest weekly outflow in over a year.With OPEC clashing over output, Turkish elections looming and the likelihood of fallout from Argentina¡¯s foreign-exchange crisis continuing, the prospect of a protracted trade war between the world¡¯s two biggest economies merely served to cast a longer pall over emerging markets. After the U.S. announced tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports last week, the Asian nation struck back with its own plan for levies on American exports. Chinese markets were closed Monday for a holiday.Trade wars ¡°have the potential to disrupt an otherwise positive economic outlook, if they were to trigger broad-based retaliatory actions,¡± said Silvia Dall¡¯Angelo, a London-based senior economist at Hermes Investment Management. ¡°The uncertainty concerning trade policies has the potential to negatively affect confidence, in turn holding back investment decisions.¡±What you Need to Know About Emerging Markets This Week: AudioHere¡¯s a roundup of the events on traders¡¯ radar as the week begins:On Wednesday, MSCI Inc. could stamp its approval on Saudi Arabia and Argentina as members of its emerging-market index.

The meeting concludes Monday with a sit-down among heads of state. The bloc will discuss strategies for trade talks with the EU.Colombian markets open after the country on Sunday elected Ivan Duque, a market-friendly U.S.-educated lawyer, by a large margin over Gustavo Petro, a former leftist guerrilla and mayor. It was the first presidential election since the signing of a historic peace accord with Marxist rebels.Meanwhile, Frans Timmermans, principal vice president of the European Commission, will kick off the week by visiting Poland amid concern about court independence. The zloty has fallen about 8 percent this quarter.Traders will monitor monetary policy decisions from the central banks of Thailand, Taiwan, Brazil, Hungary and the Philippines this week. Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is set to decide on Wednesday whether to proceed with a second increase in the benchmark interest rate after inflation reached a five-year high after last month¡¯s move. The Philippine peso is the worst-performing Asian currency this year, with losses of more than 6 percent against the dollar.Trading will resume in Indonesia on Wednesday after a seven-day holiday. Investors will be processing a slew of events, from the Fed¡¯s much-anticipated rate hike to dovish guidance from the ECB.

"BlackRock, Wells Fargo Are Betting on Ethical Investing Funds for 401(k)s","Doing good and saving for retirement may soon get easier.BlackRock Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. are developing their first-ever ESG funds for retirement savings plans, seeking to tap into growing demand for ethical investing. Both firms plan to create a series of target-date funds with this focus, according to people familiar with the matter, with BlackRock aiming to debut some later this year.The asset managers are betting that a surge in interest in environmental, social or governance investing will carry through to 401(k)s, where there are few such options. While assets under management in ESG funds tracked by Bloomberg rose 37 percent in 2017 to more than $445 billion, less than 10 percent of 401(k) plans now offer such choices, according to Edward Farrington, executive vice president for retirement strategies at Natixis Investment Managers.The move is aimed at spurring reluctant millennials to invest more for retirement. There¡¯s evidence that a younger generation of investors want such options and have yet to create a nest egg for the future. About two-thirds of millennials have saved nothing for retirement, according to a National Institute on Retirement Security report in February.Farrell Denby, a BlackRock spokesman, declined to comment on specific plans. Under Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink, the New York-based firm has said companies should align their interests with societal needs. BlackRock engages with about 1,600 companies each year on a range of ESG issues and incorporates them into the company¡¯s investment analysis.¡°As a fiduciary to our clients, BlackRock has a responsibility to protect and enhance the value of the assets they have entrusted to us,¡± Denby said in an emailed statement. ¡°We believe sustainability-related issues can play an important role in driving long term company strategy and economic performance, and thus carefully incorporating these considerations into the investment research and portfolio construction process can enhance long-term risk-adjusted returns.¡±A Wells Fargo spokesman, Robert Julavits, declined to comment. Its asset management unit oversees about $500 billion in assets.Retirement accounts hold the bulk of rising target-date fund assetsSource: Investment Company Institute*Includes 403(b)s, 457s, other private defined contribution plansTarget-date funds, which offer a mix of investments and automatically rebalance as workers age, have become popular choices for investors. The category saw net inflows of $68 billion in 2017 and ended the year with $1.1 trillion in assets, according to data compiled by the Investment Company Institute. Over the past 10 years, net inflows have totaled $521 billion.But fund managers expect it could take years to get ESG funds added to typically conservative retirement plans.ESG funds are keeping pace with the broader market. Year to date, the iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF (ticker: DSI) and the iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF (ticker: SUSA), among the biggest exchange-traded funds in the category, have gained 6.1 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively, on a total return basis. The iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (ticker: IVV) is up 5 percent.BlackRock, the world¡¯s largest asset manager, and Wells Fargo see ESG as a growth engine for retirement assets even as the U.S. Labor Department has urged retirement plan sponsors to use caution in this area. In April, the department issued guidance to sponsors saying ESG investments may not always be ¡°prudent.¡± Under the Obama administration, the Labor Department tried to remove perceived barriers to socially responsible investing by retirement funds.The guidance could cause plan sponsors to think twice before implementing ESG strategies, according to Alex Bernhardt, U.S. head of responsible investment at consulting firm Mercer. Last month the U.S. Government Accountability Office also asked the Labor Department to clarify its latest guidance.But firms like Natixis, the Boston-based unit of the French bank, are moving ahead with young investors in mind. The firm started the first suite of ESG target-date funds specifically for U.S. retirement savers last year after a survey of millennials found that 71 percent would put more money in retirement plans if they thought the investments were doing social good."
"Mexicans Hold Off From Buying New Cars On Election, Nafta Fears","Uncertainty over the future of Nafta and the upcoming presidential elections is discouraging Mexicans from buying new cars.Sales of cars and light trucks fell 7 percent in May, marking 12 straight months of drops, according to a trade group of the nation¡¯s auto dealers known as AMIA.The decline comes a mere three weeks before Mexico votes for its next president. Traders are concerned that Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftist candidate who holds a 26 percentage point lead over his nearest rival, could upend the economy at the same time that Nafta negotiations with the U.S. are at an impasse. Doubts about the future of the trade deal increased after President Donald Trump clashed with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last week.Car sales in Mexico have fallen for 12 straight monthsSource: Mexico auto chamber AMIAAll the uncertainty in economic, political and social matters ¡°is being reflected in consumers¡¯ disposition to acquire durable goods in the short term,"" said Guillermo Rosales, a top official at AMIA in a press conference Tuesday.One reassuring thought: Automakers in Mexico mainly depend on the country as a manufacturing platform to supply foreign markets, such as the U.S. In May, Mexico¡¯s production grew 3.9 percent year over year."
"U.S. CFO Optimism Remains Close to All-Time High, Survey Shows","Optimism among chief financial officers in the U.S. held near an all-time high in the second quarter, while the hiring and retaining of workers in a tight labor market remained a top concern.An index of CFO sentiment was little changed at 71.1 after a first-quarter reading of 71.2 that was the highest since the survey began in 1996, according to a report Wednesday from Duke University¡¯s Fuqua School of Business and CFO Magazine. The survey of 228 companies was conducted from May 22 to June 8.Companies expect wages and salaries to increase 4.1 percent on average over the next 12 months, up from a 3.9 percent average in the previous survey. Low unemployment is putting pressure on U.S. firms, as 41 percent of CFOs said attracting and retaining qualified employees was among their main concerns -- the biggest share of any choice. Government policies came in second at 31 percent, little changed from the prior survey.Company officers¡¯ expectations for average growth in capital spending fell 2.7 points from the previous quarter to 8.3 percent. Concerns about data security also remained high: Almost a fifth of the U.S. CFOs said their computer systems have been hacked. In response, 71 percent have installed new software or procedures to further protect their businesses, according to the Duke survey.¡°Ten years ago, cybersecurity was not a C-suite responsibility. Now it is,¡± Duke professor Cam Harvey, a founding director of the survey, said in a statement. ¡°To fight this battle costs money, which falls right off the bottom line.¡±"
Rush Into Hot CLO Market Leaves Latecomers Fighting for Scraps,"The feeding frenzy sparked by the need for protection against rising interest rates is forcing a flood of firms in the U.S. market for bundled corporate loans to fight over scraps.Demand is so strong in Wall Street¡¯s hottest debt market that the number of managers doing business there jumped by about 20 percent last year and continues to increase. And while the market itself may be on pace for record sales this year, the throng clamoring for collateralized loan obligations is rising faster, enticing issuers to weaken terms to an extent that some say doesn¡¯t compensate investors enough for the risk. But so far, there¡¯s plenty of takers.¡°One of the risks is market exuberance with everyone chasing the same collateral,¡± said Peter Sallerson, a senior director at Moody¡¯s Analytics Inc. ¡°Credit terms are getting weaker than some think they should be.¡±Spreads retracted for each type of CLO issuance amid intense investor appetite Source: Fitch RatingsWith underwriting standards eroding amid the brisk demand, managers have been forced to reach for smaller and less liquid loans to get higher spreads, according to Maggie Wang, head of U.S. CLO research at Citigroup Inc.¡°Everyone wants to get the best loans, and there¡¯s only so much of them,¡± Wang said.One example is the changing loan covenants, which are agreements between the issuers and borrowers that permit or restrict certain activities. This risk can get passed on to investors.¡°In a nut shell, deals are coming with lower coupons and less structural and document protections than we would like to see,¡± said Gretchen Lam, a portfolio manager at Octagon Credit Investors LLC. ¡°That is something we continue to be challenged with as a buy-side community.¡±New CLO deals may be on pace to reach an all-time high of $150 billion this year, according to Wells Fargo & Co. New issuance increased 65 percent in 2017 from a year earlier, while refinancings and resets, which renew the coupon and the terms on an issue, reached $166 billion last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.A recent rule change has boosted supply. An appeals court ruled in February that firms no longer need to keep a percentage of the securities they sell, setting free a wave of assets into the market. As a result, more managers entered the market because the end of risk retention made it cheaper and easier to put together CLOs.While the volume of deals has increased, so has the number of managers. Sixteen firms, 12 of whom are new, entered the sector, raising the total to 99 at the end of last year, Wells Fargo said. Four have made debuts so far this year: CarVal Investors, Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors, Partners Group and Post Advisory Group.The number of new managers entering the CLO market is on the riseSource: Wells Fargo SecuritiesBut calling these CLO managers ¡°new¡± might be a stretch. Some of the firms have deep roots in the credit market and others have poached industry veterans to lead new departments. The market is also seeing former players reemerge. For instance, PPM America came back to the market on Friday for the first time since 2007.¡°Toward the later innings of a cycle, this is not surprising that you see this given the supply and demand dynamics,¡± Chris Mawn, head of CarVal¡¯s corporate loan business who was hired last year from CLO firm Highland Capital, said in reference to the looser underwriting standards. ¡°You just have to be all the more diligent in picking your spots and where you want to take risk.¡±But few in the market are panicking. Many managers have baked in more protections in CLOs than during the financial crisis, when they performed well. The credit quality of issuers whose loans are in CLOs remained relatively stable during the first quarter, though defaults increased, according to S&P Global Ratings. The default rate for junk-rated corporate debt rose to 3.3 percent in March from 3.1 percent at the end of last year, the firm said in a note.Even still, the economy and credit market will shift at some point -- a majority of analysts polled by Bloomberg see a slowdown over the next two years -- and CLO investors may now be more exposed than in the past.¡°This is a natural progression through a credit cycle where spreads are so tight and so focused on floating rate assets,¡± Berkin Kologlu, a portfolio manager at Angel Oak Capital Advisors, said. ¡°There¡¯s not a whole lot you can do in fixed income.¡±¡ª With assistance by Adam Tempkin"
U.S. Index Futures Tumble as U.S. Pledges Action Against Tariffs,"U.S. stock index futures dropped along with European and Asian stocks amid deepening concerns over the impact of potential global trade restrictions as the U.S. vowed to take action against ¡°unjustified tariffs¡±. Canada is said to be preparing new measures to prevent a potential flood of steel imports from global producers seeking to avoid U.S. tariffs.Futures on the S&P 500 sank 0.8 percent while contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index tumbled 0.9 percent and Nasdaq futures were down 1.2 percent. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said that ¡°duties that have been announced on U.S. exports are completely without justification under international rules.¡±President Donald Trump signaled he may take a less confrontational path toward curbing Chinese investments in sensitive American technologies, potentially relying on a U.S. committee that scrutinizes foreign acquisitions for national security risks. China¡¯s Ministry of Commerce said that it is paying close attention to developments and will evaluate the potential impact on Chinese companies, while Canada plans a combination of quotas and tariffs aimed at certain countries including China, following similar ¡°safeguard¡± measures being considered by the European Union.In Europe, stocks reversed early gains, driven lower in part by the auto sector hitting its lowest level since September 2017 amid worries over trade tensions. Banks also fell as bond yields further slipped, with the U.S. 10-year yield hitting a one-week low of 2.85 percent."
"In Retailer Bankruptcies, Private Equity Comes Under Fire","Don¡¯t try to shortchange Jay Wintrob or Mark Brodsky in bankruptcy court when your retail buyout goes bust.Wintrob¡¯s Oaktree Capital Group and Brodsky¡¯s Aurelius Capital Management are kicking back at private equity owners in separate Chapter 11 cases, as investors lose patience for tactics that buyout firms use to reduce their own risks.Oaktree is contesting Apollo Global Management LLC¡¯s role in restructuring Claire¡¯s Stores Inc., while Aurelius is zeroed in on plans by Sycamore Partners to turn around Nine West Holdings Inc. Both funds claim the sponsors deprived other creditors of fair recoveries, either by extracting assets before the cases reached court or through their reorganization strategies afterward. While objections from junior creditors are common, and often resolved quickly, Oaktree and Aurelius both know their way around the courtroom, and have abundant resources to press their cases.¡°Creditors have become more sensitive to private equity sponsors using loopholes to take value away from them,¡± said Anthony P. Canale, global head of research at the independent firm Covenant Review. He cited coercive debt exchanges that give cooperative creditors a higher priority than holdouts, and strategies that move valuable intellectual property out of lenders¡¯ reach.Moody&apos;s Covenant Quality Indicator, which tracks risks tied to credit terms, has been on the rise. A higher number indicates increasing laxity.SOURCE: Moody&apos;s
Figure for 2018 is as of April, all others year-end.Even as they willingly lend to faltering companies, investors often grumble about debt-funded dividends for the sponsors, carve-out transactions and unwelcome bond exchanges. Those tactics aren¡¯t new; some have been around for decades, and buyout firms say they¡¯re justified by the high risk they assume when trying to turn around retailers that might otherwise die.But Oaktree has said in court that Apollo went too far by using its ¡°unfettered control¡± of Claire¡¯s to its own advantage. The group led by Aurelius contends in filings that Sycamore reserved the best parts of Nine West for itself. Representatives for Apollo, Claire¡¯s, Oaktree and Sycamore declined to comment. Aurelius didn¡¯t respond to messages.¡°Over the past year, we have seen a handful of bond deals introduce, or try to introduce, a new avenue that companies could use to make uncapped intellectual property transfers to unrestricted subsidiaries,¡± Moody¡¯s Investors Service analysts wrote in a May report. In some recent cases, lenders have pushed to close the loopholes before the debt deals are final, the analysts said.Debtholders are still smarting over J. Crew Group¡¯s 2017 asset shuffle, which shunted the company¡¯s brand and other valuable holdings to a subsidiary that lenders couldn¡¯t touch. That maneuver is a model for what lenders don¡¯t want to happen to them. Creditors of PetSmart Inc. and Revlon Inc. have worried they may be next, and ratings firms have warned that more companies have credit agreements that leave debtholders vulnerable.At Tops Friendly Markets, lower-ranking creditors of the bankrupt grocery chain, ranging from bankers to bakers, want to investigate the 2007 buyout, saying the private equity owners extracted more than $380 million in dividends, fees and other payments while adding debt.While J. Crew is the retail debtor most closely identified with spiriting away intellectual property, Claire¡¯s actually did it first. The tween jewelry chain staged a 2016 debt overhaul that sent trademark rights to a European subsidiary, insulating the brands¡¯ value from from creditors.Claire¡¯s, which is based in Pembroke Pines, Florida, then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March this year. Under the proposed restructuring deal, Apollo and the lenders get ownership of the reorganized Claire¡¯s and the chance to provide exit loans. The financing would require total payments of more than $1.5 billion to Apollo and allies in exchange for $575 million to finance a Claire¡¯s turnaround, the fund said.Oaktree derided Apollo¡¯s initial exit financing plan as the ¡°laughingstock of the distressed investing community,¡± saying in court papers it unduly treats senior lenders including Apollo and Elliott Capital Management better than lower-ranking creditors.Oaktree, which is run by Wintrob and whose founders include Howard Marks and Bruce Karsh, holds more than 70 percent of Claire¡¯s $220 million second-lien debt, according to court documents. Apollo holds an undisclosed amount of Claire¡¯s senior debt, which allows it to benefit from the proposed reorganization. Its allies, including Elliott and Monarch Alternative Capital, are the biggest senior lenders, with more than $970 million of the $1.4 billion in first-lien notes.Aurelius is leading a group of unsecured creditors that allege similar flaws in Nine West¡¯s April bankruptcy, which they contend is rooted in how Sycamore managed the 2014 leveraged buyout of the shoe and fashion company. Sycamore issued debt through the company to take it private, but then bought three of the subsidiaries for Sycamore¡¯s direct ownership -- at what the group¡¯s lawyers say was a below-market rate.Weekly Credit Brief: Private Equity Under Fire in Retail RestructuringSycamore sold two of the brands in 2015 and dealt the third back to Nine West in 2017, ¡°reaping hundreds of millions of dollars of benefit,¡± a lawyer for the Aurelius group said in a May 7 hearing. On top of that, the group claims a proposed $50 million bankruptcy loan is ¡°exorbitantly expensive.¡±Aurelius holds about $164 million of Nine West¡¯s unsecured notes, a relatively small slice of Nine West¡¯s $1.6 billion in debt. But Aurelius¡¯s Brodsky has a reputation for being litigious, and his group includes sizable allies including mall operator Simon Property Group. The next hearing for Nine West is June 18; Claire¡¯s is scheduled for June 13.Such disputes would be less likely if lenders pushed back harder on lax covenants allowing asset transfers, according to debt research firm Xtract Research.¡°Deals should be negotiated to prevent these types of material transfers so that lenders don¡¯t have to sit at the edge of their seats waiting to see whether a borrower will take advantage,¡± said Jenny Warshafsky, an Xtract covenant analyst.¡ª With assistance by Tiffany Kary"
Pound Political Trauma May Continue Even With BOE Back in Focus,"The pound began the week on the back foot as it faces political turmoil amid the Conservative Party¡¯s ongoing internal battle over Brexit.With a decision still awaited on whether the U.K. Parliament gets a say on the final deal to leave the European Union, sterling will likely be sensitive to the outcomes of a vote in the House of Lords Monday and another in the Commons Wednesday. Focus will return to monetary policy Thursday, when the Bank of England announces its latest decision, which may offer clues on the likelihood of an August interest-rate increase.¡°For the BOE, the message is unlikely to change and if anything, could firm up August pricing, supporting the pound,¡± said Jordan Rochester, an analyst at Nomura International Plc. ¡°However, the politics is on the edge of turning and it would take just one headline suggesting a leadership contest to wipe out any BOE-related gains.¡±Strategists and investors will be scanning media reports for any hint that Prime Minister Theresa May is facing a leadership challenge as her party remains split over the so-called ¡®meaningful vote,¡¯ which would let Parliament vote on the final Brexit deal. After a weekend dominated by political headlines, some hard-line pro-Brexit Conservative lawmakers have privately warned they could move to oust May if the parliamentary votes this week go against them.The pound fell 0.3 percent to $1.3243 on Monday, staying close to a 2018 low touched on May 29. Implied volatility on one-week sterling-dollar options has climbed ahead of the parliamentary votes.With monetary policy back on the agenda, U.K. government bonds could also be vulnerable after rallying last week amid broader haven demand. Investors are divided over the probability of an August rate increase, currently priced by money markets at just over 50 percent. After last week¡¯s mixed economic data brought little clarity, the central bank¡¯s comments on the economy will be keenly read by market participants.¡°The most the market can expect is an acknowledgment that things have not picked up as the BOE had been forecasting -- which would be bullish¡± for gilts, Societe Generale SA strategist Jason Simpson said. ¡°But the Monetary Policy Committee is likely to reiterate the view that rates still need to rise, in line with previous statements.¡±"
Nasdaq Stockholm Says MiFID II Creates New Conflicts of Interest,"Europe¡¯s revision of market rules was supposed to address a key conflict of interest in financial research. But in doing so, it may well have caused a ¡°more controversial¡± conflict, according to Nasdaq Stockholm AB.The issue in question is the finance industry¡¯s response to a requirement to unbundle research, following on from the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. MiFID II was meant to provide transparency by splitting research from brokerage services in the fee structure. But Lauri Rosendahl, the president of Nasdaq in the Nordics, says there¡¯s now a questionable link between the research being done and those paying for it.Lauri Rosendahl¡°I¡¯m still worried that MiFID II will have consequences on research that the regulators didn¡¯t take into account when setting the regulations,¡± he said in an interview.Living with MiFID II: Six Months In, What¡¯s the State of Play?Since MiFID II took effect in January, banks have increasingly been getting their fees from the companies they analyze for investors. That means that the subject of the research is also providing the financial incentive to carry out the impartial analysis.¡°The question from a regulator perspective is: is this a better conflict of interest than the pre-MiFID II regulation? My personal opinion is that this is actually a more controversial and difficult situation. At least when it comes to the credibility of the research,¡± Rosendahl said.According to the Nasdaq Nordic president, last year about 300 of the roughly 1,000 listed companies traded on the exchange he helps oversee were paying for research on themselves. Rosendahl, who has himself worked as an equity analyst at investment banks including ABN Amro Holding NV, says that figure is heading toward 400, and ¡°will likely keep growing.¡±He says the development is a ¡°positive but controversial surprise.¡±Meanwhile, MiFID II is leading to several other changes in the way equity research is done. Rosendahl says the directive has ¡°led to brokers having a hard time in maintaining their previous levels of research coverage.¡± Some ¡°have also cut the number of equities analysts, making it more difficult for them to track"" small and medium-sized enterprises.¡°This is naturally bad for our listed companies, since we have a lot of listed SMEs,¡± he said.Then there¡¯s the matter of so-called systematic internalizers. These tend to be larger banks that decide to trade directly with clients outside organized markets like Nasdaq. More lenders are doing so, because it relieves their clients of new reporting requirements demanded by MiFID II.Rosendahl says this development also raises questions.¡°After the MiFID II implementation, we can see that there¡¯s a trend toward much more SI-regulated equity trading,¡± he said. ¡°I think regulators should look in the mirror and ask themselves whether the end result with bilateral SI trading is better than the multilateral dark-pool trading and broker-crossing networks that we previously had.¡±¡°With multilateral dark pools, there¡¯s at least the opportunity that end-investor interests can meet and match a buyer with a seller, while in SIs, everything is only done against the balance sheets of the banks and brokers.¡±Rosendahl says the question is whether, ¡°from a European risk perspective, is it good that 30 percent of all European equity trading is now bilateral against the bank balance sheets?¡±¡ª With assistance by Frances Schwartzkopff"
South Africa Police Probing Three Fraud Cases at Steinhoff,"A South African police unit is probing three cases of fraud at Steinhoff International Holdings NV after the embattled retailer submitted a series of allegations against former Chief Executive Officer Markus Jooste.Two of the cases were reported in Stellenbosch, where Steinhoff is based, and one in Johannesburg, Minister of Police Bheki Cele said in a reply to a parliamentary question emailed on Friday. As well as fraud, one of the Stellenbosch cases adds theft, extortion, forgery and a failure to report knowledge of wrongdoing to the list of offenses.Markus JoosteJooste, 57, quit as CEO of Steinhoff on Dec. 5, the day the owner of Conforama in France, Mattress Firm in the U.S. and Poundland in the U.K. reported accounting irregularities that have wiped more than 95 percent off the company¡¯s share price. Steve Booysen, the chairman of Steinhoff¡¯s audit committee, submitted the report against Jooste to the Hawks, as the police unit is known, at the end of January.Read More: How Jooste profited from Steinhoff property deals.Steinhoff itself is being investigated by legal authorities and regulators around the world and is being sued by a Dutch investor group and former Chairman Christo Wiese. The retailer has appointed PwC to probe its finances, with a particular focus on off-balance-sheet structures and deals with related parties. Its findings are expected to be published by the end of the year.Steinhoff¡¯s report accuses Jooste of being party to the falsification of accounting records, providing false or misleading information with a fraudulent purpose, being party to an act or omission by Steinhoff calculated to defraud creditors, employees or shareholders, and being party to untrue written statements required by the Companies Act, Cele said.Steinhoff shares fell 0.9 percent to 8 euro cents as of 11:31 a.m. in Frankfurt, where the company moved its primary listing in 2015. Separately on Friday, Steinhoff won support of creditors representing 85 percent of the external debt of Steinhoff Europe to extend a support period for the company to agree to a debt restructuring plan.¡ª With assistance by Janice Kew"
China Is Expected to Defend Yuan If It Weakens About 1% Further,"China¡¯s authorities, who¡¯ve allowed the steepest yuan decline since the 2015 devaluation, are likely to step in and defend the currency should it fall further to a key level.Most of the 18 traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg say policy makers will act to slow the currency¡¯s slide once it gets close to 6.7 per dollar in China¡¯s onshore market. That¡¯s about 1 percent below current levels. The yuan was little changed at 6.6266 a dollar in early London trading on Friday.The focus on 6.7 implies that Chinese officials are seen as comfortable with the currency¡¯s slump so far, even though its 11-day losing streak in Hong Kong through Thursday was the longest on record. Still, a pattern of stronger-than-expected daily fixings suggests policy makers remain on watch for any signs of the panic that spurred heavy outflows in 2015.The managed currency has slumped 3.4 percent since June 14 -- the worst performer in emerging markets -- as concern over a slowdown in the world¡¯s second-largest economy collided with anxiety over the trade war with the U.S. So far, the authorities refrained from heavy-handed intervention to stem the declines, a sign that some analysts say may suggest the policy makers are comfortable with the weakness and could allow even more.A selloff in Chinese equities, which tumbled into a bear market this week, also soured sentiment toward the yuan, which until a few weeks ago served as an anchor for developing economies battling against the headwinds of rising global interest rates and the resurgent dollar.China has already drawn on some of its arsenal to stem the drop, to little avail. The yuan is confined to a trading band 2 percent either side of a reference rate set by the central bank each day, but so far stronger-than-expected fixings have been largely ignored by the market.In order to prevent a break of 6.7, China could employ a number of tools, those surveyed said. Policy makers may continue to strengthen the reference rates, act to tighten liquidity levels between banks, or ramp up capital controls. A number of respondents also flagged the possibility of outright intervention.¡°Until there¡¯s any noticeable improvement in sentiment -- which could lead to capital inflows in the bond and equity markets -- the yuan will remain under pressure,¡± said Tommy Ong, managing director for treasury and markets at DBS Hong Kong Ltd. But while Chinese intervention may trigger short-term rebounds in the currency, Ong said he expects it to continue declining this year.Intervention was suspected on Wednesday, when the currency temporarily found a floor at 6.6 per dollar. At least one major Chinese bank was said to have sold dollars in the onshore market to keep the yuan stronger than 6.6. But while the currency did pare declines at the end of the Shanghai trading day, it extended losses on Thursday.China may act to slow the?yuan¡¯s slide once it gets close to?6.7?per dollar. Bloomberg¡¯s Tian Chen reports.China has a history of acting to prevent the yuan breaching psychologically-important levels, amid concern breaks hammer market confidence and can trigger a snowball effect. When the currency weakened beyond 6.7 per dollar in the Hong Kong market in September 2016, offshore yuan borrowing costs spiked, which some traders put down to Chinese intervention.The yuan¡¯s losses have fueled a wave of selling in emerging markets, with currencies from India to South Africa sliding as sentiment deteriorates. Developing-nation assets are set to cap their worst quarter since 2015, with the outlook for continued friction over trade between China and the U.S.A leaked report from a top Chinese think tank warned of the potential for ¡°financial panic¡± in the country amid the market selloff, read more here.On Friday, the overseas exchange rate climbed 0.1 percent after touching a seven-month low.

Contrarian Stock Signal Echoes in Record Small-Business Optimism,"Will record levels of optimism among U.S. small-business owners keep the fire burning beneath a small-cap rally that itself has reached new highs? Not if history is a guide.While the number of respondents saying it¡¯s a good time to expand reached a record 34 percent last month, according to a National Federation of Independent Business survey released Tuesday, previous peaks have actually led to short-term stock declines.Since 1979, the Russell 2000 Index has declined on average 2.9 percent in the six months following a peak in the NFIB ¡°Good Time to Expand¡± gauge, according to a study from Jason Goepfert, president of Sundial Capital Research Inc. The average decline over a three-month period was 0.4 percent, he said.¡°Overall, it¡¯s a mild warning sign that things have gotten about as good as they can get for the small guys out there,¡± Goepfert said in a note to clients Tuesday. ¡°The highest levels of optimism have led to mixed returns.¡±Small-business sentiment has remained high since President Donald Trump¡¯s election in late 2016, with tax cuts, reduced regulations and solid economic growth supporting the optimistic outlook. The NFIB survey suggests little negative impact from this year¡¯s trade disputes, alongside freight bottlenecks that have pushed up costs for some businesses.The Russell 2000 rose to a fresh record Tuesday, extending its year-to-date gain to almost 10 percent. The gauge has risen about 46 percent over the last two years, outperforming the 34 percent gain in its larger-capitalized counterpart, the S&P 500."
Japan¡¯s Jobless Rate Falls to Lowest in a Quarter Century,"Japan¡¯s tightest labor market in decades just got even tighter, driving companies to hire more workers in full-time, permanent positions. That¡¯s positive news for the Bank of Japan as it struggles to generate 2 percent inflation. Consumer prices in Tokyo, a leading indicator for the nation, rose more than expected after two months of slower increases.The employment data released on Friday point to stronger upward pressure on wages, which so far haven¡¯t responded as expected to the super-tight labor market. As companies struggle to find workers they¡¯re hiring more staff on permanent, full-time contracts, which generally means higher pay and benefits. A job-applicant ratio at a 44-year high also points in the right direction for wages and inflation.Still, challenges to the economy abound. The export-dependent nation faces fallout from global trade tensions and the slowing of growth in China. Japan¡¯s factory output fell slightly in May after rising for three consecutive months.¡ª With assistance by Won Jae Ko"

Saudi Aramco Taps Silicon Valley Startup in Plastics Push,"Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world¡¯s biggest oil exporter, struck a deal to use a California startup¡¯s chemical technology in new multi-billion-dollar crude-to-chemical factories.Saudi Aramco, as the oil giant is known, plans to employ Siluria Technologies Inc.¡¯s process for converting natural gas left over from the crude-refining process into ethylene, the primary building block for plastics, according to a joint announcement by the companies on Wednesday.

May Scrambles for Brexit Compromise as Tory Tensions Rise,"U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May is in a frantic search for the perfect compromise. Her mission is clear: to find a way to unite the warring Brexit factions in her party before they derail the government.May¡¯s officials started work Wednesday drafting a new clause in her key piece of Brexit legislation, after she narrowly avoided a defeat in Parliament by offering last-minute concessions to pro-EU lawmakers. The new text will probably reduce the chances of Britain tumbling out of the bloc without a deal -- something businesses and investors fear as the worst case scenario.But as talks get going, May has two factions to please. The text needs to honor her pledge to pro-EU Tories that she¡¯ll take account of their concerns about the possibility of leaving the bloc without a deal and give Parliament more say over the process.If she fails to deliver, she will lose their goodwill and face a backlash she won¡¯t be able to contain, people familiar with the matter said. Within hours of the agreement being struck, each side had a different version of what had been agreed, with the pro-Brexit camp saying the rebels were overstating the scale of the concession.¡°I trust our PM to honor the undertaking she gave,¡± said Anna Soubry, one of the pro-EU Tory rebels. ¡°I am sure a sensible amendment will be forthcoming which we can all agree to.¡± As of midday on Tuesday, talks were ongoing.Anna SoubryMay is racing against the clock on Brexit and fighting battles on multiple fronts. The U.K. will leave the EU in March next year, but talks in Brussels are struggling to make headway. The slow progress is in part because the premier can¡¯t get her cabinet to agree on the kind of post-Brexit trade regime they want the U.K. to have with the EU.In London, Parliament is considering crucial pieces of law that need to be passed in order for the U.K. to leave the bloc without causing legal chaos. Opposition lawmakers are trying to change the draft to bind the U.K. more closely to the EU¡¯s trade rules.Read more: Stuck In the Middle: These Are Theresa May¡¯s Four Brexit OptionsAt the same time, May must avoid angering pro-Brexit Tories, some of whom have threatened to try to oust her as leader if she betrays their vision of a clean break from the bloc.¡°It is hugely irresponsible, and I can¡¯t believe those who are perpetrators of this don¡¯t know what they are doing,¡¯¡¯ Conservative lawmaker Andrew Bridgen told the BBC¡¯s Today program on Wednesday. ¡°This is a betrayal of the British people.¡¯¡¯¡°Being in the European Union is like being pregnant -- you¡¯re either pregnant or you¡¯re not. You¡¯re either in the EU or you¡¯re not,¡¯¡¯ he said.The problem for the prime minister is that she can¡¯t keep both sides happy. One pro-Brexit minister insisted the rebels had lost, and warned that if they continued to fight May they would only make a ¡°no deal¡± divorce more likely.The premier now has until Friday to draft a legally watertight amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill which will be acceptable to both sides.There¡¯s no time to get the wording of the compromise text wrong because it will probably be debated and voted on in the House of Lords on Monday, according to one senior government official. If the compromise fails, the rebels are likely to revert back to their original motion, which would potentially strip May of control over running the Brexit negotiations and hand it to Parliament, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.¡°I have a problem both constitutionally and politically¡± with a resolution that has the House of Commons ¡°directing the process,¡± Solicitor general Robert Buckland told the BBC on Wednesday. ¡°There is no gap here. The government is very clear about its commitment to a new amendment.¡¯¡¯Nicky MorganEither way, the chances are increasing that Parliament will get a greater say over Brexit.¡°A lot of people voted to take back control, well a lot of control is now going to come back to our sovereign Parliament,¡± Nicky Morgan, a high-profile pro-EU lawmaker, said in an interview on Bloomberg TV on Wednesday. ¡°As elected representatives I think it¡¯s right that we do have a say.¡±"

This Analyst Uses 80s Rock Classics to Write About Oil Stocks,"Over in the securities industry, analysts are trying anything they can to stand out from the crowd.Take Laban Yu of Jefferies Group LLC in Hong Kong, who has written recent reports with titles including ¡°Livin¡¯ on a Prayer,¡± ¡°This Thing Called Love I Just Can¡¯t Handle It,¡± and ""I Just Can¡¯t Get Enough.¡±The catch? They¡¯re about Chinese oil, gas and coal companies.While Yu is clearly amusing himself -- and his readers -- by invoking Bon Jovi and Queen to make serious points about PetroChina Co. and China Shenhua Energy Co., there¡¯s also method to this frivolity. The goal, the 43-year-old Cornell University graduate said, is to make the reports impossible to ignore in a world of shrinking budgets for equity research and information overload from the internet.¡°It started as a joke,¡± Yu said in an interview. ¡°Then I found out it¡¯s a bottomless pit. I could do this forever. And it gets to the point where, if you have a good title, the note writes itself.¡±Yu¡¯s Livin¡¯ on a Prayer note, for example, was about how the top Chinese coal companies posted strong earnings on the back of a government-supported coal price, and how he believed the policy had reversed. He turned to Depeche Mode -- I Just Can¡¯t Get Enough -- to commentate on supply and demand in the natural gas market.Yu, who was voted the most popular energy analyst in Asia for three years running in the Asiamoney Brokers Poll after he started at Jefferies in 2011, has good reason to want to differentiate himself. Spending in the $5 billion investment research industry is estimated to fall on average by as much as 30 percent due to the European Union¡¯s revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, according to management consultancy Oliver Wyman.It¡¯s perhaps not surprising that Yu, who¡¯s now head of Asia oil and gas research at Jefferies, is doing things differently from his peers. Born in China and raised in the U.S., Yu didn¡¯t take the standard path to becoming an analyst. Instead, he studied mechanical engineering and international relations before setting off to spend two years in Cameroon with the Peace Corps, and helping to run a startup in China that later failed.Sometimes, Yu said, he searches for lyrics to describe a situation.

Argentina Peso Falls as Government Fails to Ease Market Concerns,"Argentina¡¯s announcement that it plans to sell $7.5 billion in the foreign exchange market to help stabilize the peso and support its budget failed to prevent the currency from falling to a new record low on Wednesday.The peso initially rose after the Finance Ministry said the central bank will conduct daily auctions on behalf of the Treasury to sell the dollars. But gains were short-lived as analysts said the measure was unlikely to provide enough support for Argentina¡¯s economy in the face of high inflation, a widening budget deficit and higher global borrowing costs.¡°The gap between inflows and the current account deficit is still huge,"" said Ezequiel Zambaglione, head of research at Buenos Aires broker Max Valores. ""But the sense is that inflows aren¡¯t guaranteed this year.

Goldman Says U.S. Investors Warming to Chinese Bond Market,"U.S. investor interest in China¡¯s bonds has seen a ¡°notable improvement¡± as the market is being steadily opened up to foreigners, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.The launch of Bond Connect in July last year, coupled with China¡¯s inclusion in the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index from April next year, has served to pique their interest over the last 12 months, Goldman analysts Danny Suwanapruti and Andrew Tilton wrote in a note Wednesday, following a visit to meet U.S. institutional investors.¡°The feedback during last week¡¯s trip is that, although it could still be a few years away before China is included into all three major global bond indices; most investors agree it really is just a matter of time,¡± they said. ¡°Several investors that we spoke with are in the process of setting up accounts and have shown significantly increased levels of interest in China¡¯s bond market.¡±Inclusion in global bond indexes such as Bloomberg Barclays, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. is expected to increase the importance of the Chinese fixed-income market to foreign investors. Goldman expects the market to almost double in size within the next four years and sees foreigners owning around 22 percent of all Chinese government bonds by the end of 2022, equivalent to about $900 billion.While investors appeared more eager to get a foothold in the nascent market, there were concerns about whether its prominence could drain liquidity from other emerging markets, in particular as it may come at a time key global central banks are becoming less accommodative, according to the strategists.¡°Given the notion that core yields are moving higher and China¡¯s fixed income markets are emerging as a new asset class compounded some investor concerns over the potential pull out of EM local currency fixed income markets over the coming years,¡± Suwanapruti and Tilton said.Meanwhile, U.S. investors expected the Chinese yuan to drift sideways in the near term as authorities don¡¯t want the currency to strengthen much further, nor do they favor a sharp depreciation that may be ¡°mistakenly construed as retaliation on trade wars,¡± the analysts wrote."
Russia to Seek Oil-Cuts Rollback for Most OPEC+ Nations,"Russia plans to propose that OPEC and its allies be allowed to return production to October 2016 levels, rolling back most but not all of their output cuts within three months, according to a person familiar with Moscow¡¯s thinking.All the nations would proportionally share out a 1.8 million barrel-a-day increase to their output limit starting as soon as July, the person said, asking not to be identified because the information isn¡¯t public. The actual boost in supply to the market would be less than that because some states, notably Venezuela, Angola and Mexico, aren¡¯t able to increase, the person said.Russia and Saudi Arabia, leaders of the group of 24 producers, already suggested boosting output to stop prices going any higher and hurting oil demand. Moscow¡¯s new proposal would go further, effectively ending the cuts for any country that has the ability to pump more crude. Such a move would have to be agreed by other members, several of whom have already come out in opposition.Some of the biggest OPEC + cutters may be unable to restore output Source: IEAThe plan could be the first of many proposals and counter-proposals from members of the group, subject to change during negotiations. Given the backing of the two largest producers participating in the accord, an output increase ¡°looks inevitable¡± Citigroup Inc. analysts led by Ed Morse said in a report on Tuesday.The group¡¯s Vienna meeting next week would be a ¡°crunch time¡± for OPEC, Warren Patterson, a commodities strategist at ING Groep NV, said in an emailed note Wednesday. ¡°We would not rule out a scenario where Russia decides to exit the deal altogether¡± if no consensus is reached, he said.Russia and Saudi Arabia are set to discuss oil policy on Thursday as teams from the two nations meet in the opening match of the soccer World Cup in Moscow. President Vladimir Putin will host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, while energy ministers Alexander Novak and Khalid Al-Falih will also meet.Putin and the crown prince will have a talk on the OPEC+ deal and the oil market situation, yet pulling out of the accord isn¡¯t something they plan to discuss, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and several non-members agreed in late 2016 to curb output by 1.8 million barrels a day in order to eliminate a supply glut that was weighing on prices. For most countries, that reduction was relative to their October 2016 production.Many nations have gone further than their pledged cuts. Saudi Arabia said it was cutting deeper to lead by example. Others, notably Venezuela, have experienced involuntary declines in production due to problems in their oil industries. In April, the group¡¯s total reduction added up to almost 2.5 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency.See also: IEA Says Iran, Venezuela Oil Output Could Slump by Almost 30%Because the cuts have gone deeper than intended, overall supply from the group would still be about 1 million barrels a day below the pre-cuts levels even after the 1.8 million-barrel quota increase, the person said.OPEC will probably overcome internal disputes to agree on a production increase next week, a Bloomberg survey shows. ING sees a possible expansion in the group¡¯s supply of between 800,000 and 1 million barrels a day this year. Citi predicted a smaller gain of about 500,000 barrels a day.Russia boosted its crude production to the highest in 14 months in the first week of June as some companies breached their caps ahead of Vienna talks, a person with knowledge of the matter said Monday.Moscow believes the new arrangement it proposes would provide stability for the oil market through a period of high demand during the northern hemisphere summer, the person said. The country would also support keeping the alliance between OPEC and other producers into 2019 -- either with or without new quotas depending on the requirements of the market, the person said.¡ª With assistance by Ilya Arkhipov"
Ex-BNP Gilts Trader Sues Bank After Being Fired for Bullying,"A former BNP Paribas SA trader caught up in allegations of bullying sued the bank for unfair dismissal, saying he was pushed out after disclosing wrongdoing on the trading floor.Xavier Dehais, who worked as a U.K. sovereign bond trader until last year, said the bank painted an unfair picture of him as someone with whom it was impossible to work. Dehais, who worked for BNP for almost eight years, said in a statement at a London Court Tuesday that he disclosed at least five instances of unauthorized trades and inflated books.""In an effort to deflect from their own wrongdoing, they made specious allegations against me that I had harassed them and generally besmirched my character,"" Dehais told a London employment tribunal.Bankers routinely turn to specialist labor courts throughout Europe to rehabilitate tarnished reputations and recoup lost bonuses. Dehais said that the bank had notified the U.K. financial watchdog following his dismissal, effectively ending his career.""The employees involved in the various instances of whistle-blowing I made, who engaged in, and in likelihood are still engaging in, what I consider to be corporate malfeasance, are still employed,"" Dehais said.BNP said in a statement that Dehais¡¯ claims were investigated and ¡°no misconduct was identified.¡±¡°We have a robust whistle-blowing procedure which is also underlined in our code of conduct,¡± the Paris-based bank said.The former trader is seeking 700,000 pounds ($933,000) in the lawsuit. Whistle-blowing claims are key parts of U.K. employment cases because they allow workers to sue for more than the standard 84,000-pound limit in unfair dismissal claims.The main dispute centers on an incident with the European government bonds sales team. Dehais and a sales executive commenced rival grievance proceedings against each other, with Dehais saying that his rival manually inflated his credit on two deals by about 70,000 euros ($82,450). The executive, meanwhile, filed his own internal complaint, alleging bullying and harassment.""His letter explained that he refused to come back to the bank as long as it meant having to work with me,"" Dehais said in his witness statement.In an earlier exchange, Dehais told the sales executive ""he was going to make my life a misery,"" according to emails read out in court.Ceri Lawrence, the employee relations adviser who handled the grievance process, said the sales executive ""broke down in tears"" when describing his exchanges with Dehais.""Xavier¡¯s conduct towards him had resulted in him dreading attending work and had affected his sleep and his personal life,"" Lawrence told the court Wednesday.Dehais said that he had seen ¡°much worse¡± on the trading floor where people were ¡°breaking keyboards and mice.¡±¡°You have to take a lot of decisions very quickly with a lot of money. People are nervous,¡± he said. ¡°Some schoolyard discussion has been transformed into bullying and harassment.""Sheila Aly, Dehais¡¯ lawyer said the bank¡¯s disciplinary procedure was ""careless.""""The process was as fair as we could make it for him,"" Lawrence said.The bust up with the sales executive wasn¡¯t the first time Dehais¡¯ conduct led to an investigation. He said that he had been previously cleared by the bank of making an inappropriate gesture in front of a female graduate employee.BNP has faced a number of recent employment cases across Europe. Earlier this month, Paris employment courts required the bank to pay more than 350,000 euros to its former global head of FX arbitrage after the bank demoted him and 812,500 euros to the former head of structured finance in the bank¡¯s Geneva office in a separate case.""The treatment I have received throughout this matter only succeeds in proving that even in the current climate with demands for increased banking transparency and accountability, it is not safe to report any wrongdoing at BNP Paribas,"" Dehais said.(A previous version of this story was corrected to fix the last name of a witness for the bank.)"
China¡¯s Evolving Toolkit to Manage Monetary Policy,"China¡¯s monetary policy is in flux, as the central bank tries to weed out risky lending while ensuring money keeps flowing to the economy.To achieve those sometimes competing goals, the People¡¯s Bank of China is engaging a mix of liquidity tools and pricing signals, while keeping its historical benchmarks dormant. An added complication: managing the impact of the Federal Reserve¡¯s exit from years of ultra-loose policy and calibrating the speed at which it opens the financial system to outsiders.The bigger picture is the PBOC¡¯s transition from being China¡¯s only lender under Mao Zedong to something resembling the Federal Reserve or the European Central Bank -- a modern institution that sets the price of short-term money using interest rates to lend in financial markets. But for now, it¡¯s not clear what that lending benchmark will be.Yi Gang, who took over the reins of the PBOC this year, cautioned recently against a too-rapid pace of change -- suggesting that officials are still focused on tweaking their own framework. That means investors need to keep watch on a variety of fronts to discern policy direction. Here¡¯s a look at the main items in the PBOC¡¯s ever-evolving toolkit.While OMOs cover a variety of tools, it usually refers to the PBOC offering reverse-repurchase agreements in the open market. The contracts are short-term loans to banks and are the most common tool to smooth money-market rates. The 7-day operation, which steers the short-end of the money-market curve, may have potential to develop into China¡¯s new policy rate. Reverse repo operations are gaining prominence as the PBOC increases the frequency of operations and adds tenors.In a broader sense, open market operations also include tools with longer tenors such as central bank bills. Regardless of the tenors, the operations can result in either a net injection or withdrawal of cash from the financial system and hence have an immediate effect on the money market.The PBOC has typically tweaked the reverse repurchase rate to keep in line with the Fed -- though it didn¡¯t immediately do so this week following a 25 basis point hike in Washington.A measure of how much cash banks must deposit at the central bank, nominally as a prudential measure to ensure lenders can handle customer withdrawals. But in China, it¡¯s an important means to manage the money supply, especially with the nation¡¯s persistent current account surpluses.While this tool had been eclipsed by innovative methods such as the Medium-term Lending Facility in recent years, it looks to be returning to favor, with two cuts this year and more forecast. In contrast to many of the central bank¡¯s lending tools, a reserve-ratio cut is a nearly cost-free liquidity source for banks. RRR cuts ensure lenders have cash to dole out to borrowers as the move toward more market-oriented interest rates drives up deposit rates.The MLF started in 2014 and allows the central bank to provide funds with longer maturities, stabilizing market expectations with tenors ranging from three months to a year. As the funds come with higher interest rates compared with reverse repos, MLFs can ensure adequate funding without flooding the banking system. MLFs also help improve rates transmission in China where financial markets still lack depth, as they set borrowing costs at the longer end of the curve.After declining in April as banks used funds that were freed up by an RRR cut to repay 900 billion yuan ($141 billion) of loans, outstanding MLF rose again in June when the PBOC injected more than expected. While the central bank says that move was intended to help fund smaller businesses and the green economy, it might not remove the need for further RRR cuts, as more than 4 trillion yuan is still outstanding.The PBOC historically used benchmark lending and deposit rates to set the basic fundraising costs for banks, companies and individuals. These are the most powerful, but bluntest tools in the PBOC¡¯s arsenal, with impact across the entire economy when changed.The rates were last altered in October 2015 and the central bank is now allowing banks some leeway above or below the official rate, as part of its liberalization. According to Yi, the strategy is to gradually ""unify"" these rates with money market rates, which the central bank controls through other tools.The PBOC¡¯s balance sheet is different in many ways from those of its western peers. With about $5.6 trillion in assets, it¡¯s the world¡¯s biggest. It¡¯s mainly foreign currency assets, because the bank bought large amounts of foreign currency to keep the yuan stable in spite of the nation¡¯s huge trade surplus and capital inflows.As China¡¯s cross-border capital flows become more balanced, the size of this position in foreign exchange will stabilize. For now, that pile forms China¡¯s war chest to manage the currency, a task entrusted to the PBOC¡¯s subsidiary, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE.The FX hoard was deployed to support the currency when a mini devaluation in mid-2015 and fears over the nation¡¯s economic slowdown weakened the yuan.The PBOC is also trying to build an interest-rate corridor that could help reduce central bank intervention in the market, by setting upper and lower bounds. It hasn¡¯t been completely successful. Part of the reason is that the intended upper bound of the corridor - the Standing Lending Facility, or the Chinese version of U.S. Discount Window - is only available for larger lenders, and actually asking to access the loans is seen as frowned upon. There have been times that the 7-day repo rate, the short-term borrowing cost of financial institutions, surged beyond the SLF lending rate with the same maturity.The PBOC has created many tools similar to the MLF to offer funding to various banks in different scenarios.¡ª With assistance by Yinan Zhao, Miao Han, Jeff Kearns, and Malcolm Scott"
"As China Markets Plunge, Here's How Vital Signs Look Versus 2015","China¡¯s stocks are tumbling, the yuan is sinking, and a government-backed think tank is warning of a potential financial panic.Is this 2015 all over again?Given the dramatic moves in Chinese markets over the past week, it¡¯s only natural to draw comparisons to the equity crash and yuan devaluation that rattled investors worldwide three years ago. There are certainly some similarities between now and then, but there are also key differences -- including cheaper equity valuations and a less interventionist response by Chinese authorities.Below is a rundown of how today¡¯s environment stacks up against that of 2015.Chinese stocks have lost almost $2 trillion in five months. That¡¯s nothing to scoff at, but the pace of declines has yet to match the market¡¯s gut-wrenching selloff in 2015. That crash erased $3.2 trillion in its first three weeks, or almost $1 billion for each minute of trading. While the Shanghai Composite Index sank more than 8 percent in a single day in August 2015, its worst session in recent weeks was the 3.8 percent drop on June 19.The picture is similar for the yuan. The 2015 devaluation triggered a nearly 3 percent drop in just two days, shocking global investors who had grown used to a stable Chinese currency. The latest slump is comparable in magnitude, but the yuan has taken about two weeks to get there. The offshore currency was slightly weaker in Hong Kong early Thursday, after falling for 10 straight days.Before its 2015 crash, China¡¯s equity market was in the throes of a classic speculative bubble. The Shanghai Composite had a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19, and hundreds of shares in the index traded for multiples that exceeded 100.The index is now valued at 10.5 times projected earnings, lower than at any time since the end of 2014. By some measures, it¡¯s the cheapest on record versus the S&P 500 Index.Hard landing or soft: the debate over whether Chinese policy makers can prevent a steep economic downturn has been raging for years. Growth was decelerating in 2015, but the central bank was very much in easing mode -- cutting interest rates and pumping gobs of money into the financial system.This time, authorities seem less willing to open the taps. While the central bank announced a cut to lenders¡¯ reserve requirements this week, policy makers are wary of backtracking on a high-profile clampdown on financial leverage. There¡¯s also the wild card of rising trade tensions: Donald Trump¡¯s threat to impose tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese imports could cut as much as half a percentage point from the nation¡¯s economic growth, according to economists.International investors have largely shaken off this year¡¯s rout in Chinese stocks. But the yuan has definitely grabbed their attention. One sign of the spillover effect: an index of firms in developed markets that get the most sales from China, including Qualcomm Inc. and Rio Tinto, has dropped about 7 percent since the yuan¡¯s decline kicked into high gear in early June.Still, the global impact was far greater in 2015, when China¡¯s surprise devaluation sparked concern that other emerging-market countries would follow. The move triggered the first 10 percent correction in the MSCI All-Country World Index of global stocks since the peak of Europe¡¯s sovereign-debt crisis in 2011. The Bloomberg Commodity Index slumped 25 percent amid fears of sinking Chinese demand, its biggest annual decline since 2008.While China¡¯s government routinely intervened in foreign exchange and stock markets in 2015, authorities appear to be taking a less heavy-handed approach these days. Yes, they¡¯ve meddled around the edges -- publishing stronger-than-estimated reference rates for the yuan and asking brokerages to refrain from sudden liquidations of shares pledged as collateral for loans. But they¡¯ve so far avoided massive interventions of the sort that whipsawed traders a few years ago.¡°We know that China will want to avoid any similarities to 2015,¡± said Timothy Graf, a macro strategist at State Street Corp. in London. ¡°They¡¯re allowing markets to do their thing, having learnt that a heavy hand doesn¡¯t work.¡±Back in 2015, it was retail margin traders who had everyone worried about China¡¯s stock market, and for good reason. Outstanding margin loans on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges topped $350 billion at their peak. When the bubble burst, losses snowballed as traders were forced to sell shares to meet margin calls.While margin debt has since shrunk by more than half, a new kind of leveraged investor has stepped into the fold. More than $770 billion of Chinese shares, or about 12 percent of the country¡¯s market capitalization, have been pledged as collateral for loans, according to data compiled by China Securities Co. and Bloomberg. The pledges, popular among company founders and other major shareholders in need of cash, have become a growing source of concern for analysts as stocks have tumbled in recent weeks.All told, leveraged purchases of shares have reached levels last seen in 2015, according to a study by China¡¯s National Institution for Finance & Development, a government-backed think tank.Three years ago, it looked like China might get caught in a never-ending spiral of capital outflows, a weakening yuan, and still more outflows. An estimated $1.7 trillion left the country in 2015 and 2016.This year, there are few signs of a repeat of that exodus. That¡¯s partly because China has tightened capital controls. But it also helps that Chinese home prices are still climbing in most big cities. Real estate makes up a large chunk of household wealth in China, and as long as values are rising there¡¯s less of an incentive to spirit money overseas. That said, the yuan has only recently started to weaken. The outflow picture could change quickly if losses continue."

He signaled that officials will hold their first full talks on unwinding stimulus at this week¡¯s Governing Council meeting.Unemployment was at 8.6 percent at the end of March and has continued to fall since then. It climbed as high as 12.1 percent during the euro area¡¯s double-dip recession."
The Philippine Peso Needs a More Hawkish Central Bank,"The Philippine currency and bond markets will need a more hawkish tone from the central bank this week to stem their losing streak, as investors fret over whether policymakers are softening their fight on inflation.The peso is at a 12-year low against the dollar even after the May 10 rate increase as central bank officials appear to clash over the prospects of further tightening. Persistent weakness in the bond market, where yields are at seven-year highs, further signal skepticism about the effectiveness of last month¡¯s rate hike in slowing inflation.With May consumer prices rising 4.6 percent, the fastest pace since at least 2013, BSP¡¯s policy rate of 3.25 percent is deep in negative territory after adjusting for inflation. The rate appears too low for an economy that has expanded more than 6 percent each quarter since mid-2015.Such concerns are reflected in the bond market where investors are demanding higher compensation for the risks of shrinking real returns. The benchmark five-year bond yield soared to 5.93 percent on June 14, the highest since 2011.The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will hold its rate meeting on June 20, a day earlier than previously scheduled. Signals from policymakers have been mixed.Governor Nestor Espenilla said he isn¡¯t closing the door on another rate hike in coming months and the BSP will examine ¡°all the potential drivers of future inflation¡± at the June meeting. But Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo is less hawkish, maintaining that the central bank doesn¡¯t use policy rates to arrest oil prices, and the May rate hike was sufficient to bring down inflation in 2019.Crude prices have stayed above $60 per barrel for most of the second quarter and economists are expecting inflation to exceed BSP¡¯s target range of 2 to 4 percent this year.While ING Groep NV and Nomura Holdings Inc. expect the BSP to tighten this week, Scotiabank predicts the central bank to keep rates on hold and the peso to fall toward 54 ahead of the policy meeting. The currency traded at 53.27 against the dollar Thursday before a public holiday the next day.Below are key Asian economic data and events due this week:"
Steel Price Surge Highlights Fears and Hopes on Trump's Tariffs,"Steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by the U.S. in March may already be filtering through to prices charged by American producers of the metals.The cost of steel mill products climbed 4.3 percent last month, the biggest increase since February 2011, a U.S. government report showed Wednesday.The report underscores concerns from metal buyers and economists that the tariffs could raise costs of goods ranging from cars to construction equipment. It also helps explain why American steelmakers¡¯ stocks have been rising. Double-digit-gains in shares of Irving, Texas-based Commercial Metals Co. and Steel Dynamics Inc. of Fort Wayne, Indiana, led an advance in the Bloomberg Americas Iron/Steel Index in May.A global gauge of iron and steel producers tracked by Bloomberg Intelligence fell last month, led by declines in Chinese companies.¡ª With assistance by Vince Golle"
"ECB Sees Domestic Demand Offsetting Stronger Euro, For Now","The European Central Bank says robust domestic demand has helped prevent a stronger currency from weighing on euro-area inflation -- so far.In a section of its economic bulletin published Wednesday, the ECB noted that exchange-rate movements can play an important role in shaping the outlook for inflation, albeit with considerable delays and differences based on the economic situation. The report comes after the euro strengthened as much as 10 percent against the dollar in the last year before weakening in recent weeks.The euro¡¯s past appreciation has been clearly visible in making consumer goods imported from outside the euro area cheaper, the ECB said. Prices of such goods declined 2 percent in April from a year ago. They make up more than a tenth of final non-energy and non-food goods consumption.While that¡¯s a drag on overall inflation, domestic producers seem to be offsetting the impact. They¡¯ve remained resilient to downward pressure due to rising labor compensation and higher capacity utilization giving companies more pricing power. Prices for non-energy industrial goods have also been stabilized by domestic forces, even though the ECB says these are most sensitive to movements in the exchange rate.That¡¯s good news for the central bank, which has struggled to stimulate low inflation for years and has only recently admitted that it¡¯s making substantial progress toward its goal. Still, it warns that effects from the exchange rate might still weigh on inflation in the near future.¡°Pass-through models suggest that the impacts are spread out over several quarters, so that the appreciation from mid-2017 might still be relevant for some quarters to come,¡± the ECB said in the report. ¡°Monitoring the impact of the past euro exchange rate appreciation on the inflation outlook is an ongoing exercise.¡±"
Walmart¡¯s Killing It in Central America,"Walmart Inc. has dialed back its global footprint this year -- retreating from Brazil and merging its U.K. business with a rival. But while the world¡¯s largest retailer is stepping away from some high-profile international markets, it¡¯s doubling down in a region that gets less attention -- Central America.Walmart¡¯s business in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica is a growing part of the retailer¡¯s publicly traded Mexican and Central American business, Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB, or Walmex. The region now accounts for almost one-fifth of Walmex¡¯s revenue, up from 14 percent in 2014.Over the same period the retailer has added more than 100 Central American stores, ranging from small bodegas to Supercenters, all of which tout the company¡¯s mantra of everyday low prices. While Mexico has been a bright spot for Walmart pretty much since Sam Walton opened a location there in 1991, Central America represents a more fertile area for growth, analysts say.Walmex has added more than 100 stores in Central America in recent yearsSource: Company filings¡°Mexico has almost always been much more profitable than the other parts of Walmart,¡± Dave Marcotte, an analyst at Kantar Retail, said. ¡°They have best-in-class concepts and processes in place in Mexico to roll out into Central America.¡±Walmart is pulling back from markets where it hasn¡¯t been able to grow, such as Brazil, in order to refocus on big bets such as India and China. While the company¡¯s operations in Central America contribute only a small amount to revenue, they fit the model of doubling down on higher growth regions.Central America has increasingly helped fuel Walmex¡¯s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization while the parent Walmart has seen declines due to the massive investments the retailer is undertaking to grow its U.S. e-commerce business and fend off Amazon.com Inc.But the path to expand online sales -- largely virgin territory in Central America -- is clear for Walmart, since Amazon is only just arriving and Latin American e-commerce firms MercadoLibre Inc. and B2W Companhia Digital are mostly focused on South America.Walmart may get a further boost if Central American economies expand as expected: The International Monetary Fund forecasts growth of 3.9 percent this year and 4 percent in 2019. That¡¯s more than twice the pace of South America¡¯s growth.The retailer¡¯s sales in Central America more than doubled to 107.4 billion pesos ($5.2 billion) in 2017 from 49.7 billion pesos in 2011.

China Think Tank Warns of Potential ¡®Financial Panic¡¯ in Leaked Note,"A leaked report from a Chinese government-backed think tank has warned of a potential ¡°financial panic¡± in the world¡¯s second-largest economy, a sign that some members of the nation¡¯s policy elite are growing concerned as market turbulence and trade tensions increase.Bond defaults, liquidity shortages and the recent plunge in financial markets pose particular dangers at a time of rising U.S. interest rates and a trade spat with Washington, according to a study by the National Institution for Finance & Development that was seen by Bloomberg News and confirmed by a NIFD official. The think tank warned that leveraged purchases of shares have reached levels last seen in 2015 -- when a market crash erased $5 trillion of value.""We think China is currently very likely to see a financial panic,¡± NIFD said in the study, which appeared briefly on the Internet on Monday, before being removed. ¡°Preventing its occurrence and spread should be the top priority for our financial and macroeconomic regulators over the next few years.¡±The study provides another indicator that China is growing concerned about the knock-on effects of trade tensions with the U.S. In recent weeks, prominent academics have begun to question if the country¡¯s slowing, trade-dependent economy can withstand a sustained dispute, which has already started to weigh on stock prices and the yuan.China should stand ready to roll out a mix of fiscal and financial-sector measures in the event of a systemic crisis, according to NIFD, which was established in 2005 as a national-level think tank backed by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

Senators Seek Probe of SEC Member Who Assailed Citi's Gun Stance,"Six Senate Democrats are asking the Securities and Exchange Commission¡¯s internal watchdog to investigate a Republican commissioner who berated Citigroup Inc. executives in a private meeting over the bank¡¯s decision to curtail some of the business it does with companies that sell guns.Michael PiwowarCommissioner Michael Piwowar may have acted inappropriately during the April 24 meeting with several bank employees that was supposed to be about derivatives rules, the lawmakers said in a letter to the SEC¡¯s inspector general. They cited a Bloomberg Businessweek story that reported Piwowar railed against the firearms policy and suggested that the bank would have difficulty finding support for its regulatory rollback requests at the Republican-led commission.¡°We do have concerns that Commissioner Piwowar may have abused his government position in an attempt to unduly influence Citigroup to reverse a business decision that conflicts with his personal and political views,¡± the senators said in the letter they are sending to SEC Inspector General Carl Hoecker on Wednesday.Read More: Citigroup¡¯s Scolding at SEC Exposes GOP Backlash Over Gun PolicyThe lawmakers¡¯ request comes after Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, asked SEC Chairman Jay Clayton about Piwowar¡¯s comments at an appropriations subcommittee hearing earlier this month.Van Hollen, who oversees the SEC as a member of the Senate Banking Committee, noted that ¡°regulatory bodies should not be using their authority to try to assert the personal opinions of the members.¡±Citigroup set its policy in the wake of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, where 17 people died. It directs clients, mainly in the retail industry, to restrict the sale of firearms to customers under 21 and to those who haven¡¯t passed a background check. It also bars the sale of bump stocks and high- capacity magazines. For those that don¡¯t agree, Citigroup said it would help move their business to another bank.Not long after Citigroup¡¯s move, Bank of America Corp. announced that it would no longer provide financing to companies that manufacture military-style weapons for civilian use. Both banks have been sharply criticized by Republican lawmakers who have warned them to stay out of social debates and stick to their core businesses like lending to consumers.Piwowar raised similar points with Citigroup and also reminded the bank that it had received billions of dollars in government aid during the financial crisis. An aide to the commissioner didn¡¯t return a call and email requesting comment. Piwowar, whose term expired this month, has announced that he will leave the agency by July 7.The letter to the inspector general was signed by Van Hollen along with Senators Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein of California, Christopher Murphy and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, and Robert Menendez of New Jersey."

Another Medtech Stock Has Quietly Slipped Into Lead in S&P; 500,"Move over Netflix Inc. and Twitter Inc., there¡¯s a new top stock in town.Abiomed Inc. investors celebrated as the stock more than tripled over the last year. That party may not be over after it replaced Wyndham Worldwide Corp. in the Standard & Poor¡¯s 500 Index last month. The heart support pump maker¡¯s run-up has been a long time coming, and its recent rally is unlikely to end here, according to Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy. Shares climbed as much as 3.4 percent today, extending a three-day advance to another record high.¡°There aren¡¯t a lot of alternatives that physicians have to this technology and there¡¯s really no competition,¡± Denhoy, who boasts a Street-high target of $460, said in a telephone interview. ¡°There are few, if any, medical device stories that have all of the facets that Abiomed does.¡±The device-maker, now with a $19 billion market capitalization, has long been regarded as a takeout target, given a differentiated product that remains years ahead of potential competition. That view continues to prevail, Denhoy said. ¡°But the valuation is pretty high so an acquirer would have to make the case that the opportunity is as enormous and open-ended as we think it is.¡±Abiomed may continue the trend of medical device and technology companies overtaking the top spot in the S&P 500 after Align Technology Inc. topped the index in 2017. For a health sub-sector that tends to be less flashy than peers in biotechnology or pharmaceuticals, it has delivered a number of the best performers in the Standard and Poor¡¯s 500 Health Care Index this year -- including Idexx Laboratories Inc. and Boston Scientific Corp."
Carlsberg Plans Local Listing for Indian Operations,"Carlsberg A/S is planning a local initial public offering of its Indian business, people with knowledge of the matter said, as it seeks to tap the growing middle class¡¯s increasing thirst for foreign beer.The Danish brewer is interviewing potential arrangers for the share sale over the next few weeks, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private.India¡¯s beer market is expected to grow to $10.7 billion by 2020, up from $8.6 billion last year, according to Euromonitor International. Carlsberg ranks third in the country with a 13.7 percent market share, the research firm¡¯s data show. It trails Kingfisher owner United Breweries Ltd., which has 39.2 percent, and Budweiser parent Anheuser-Busch InBev NV, which has 23.3 percent.¡°This is a well-timed move, and we are expecting Carlsberg to price this issue aggressively,¡± said Kranthi Bathini, director of Mumbai-based financial advisory firm WealthMills Securities Pvt. ¡°Rising disposable incomes and changing attitudes toward alcohol among young urban consumers make this a good India consumption story that investors will lap up.¡±Carlsberg may be attracted by the high valuations in the Indian stock market, where United Breweries trades at about 73 times this year¡¯s estimated earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shares of the Bengaluru-based company have risen 61 percent over the past 12 months, outpacing the 15 percent gain in the benchmark S&P BSE?Sensex. Diageo Plc¡¯s local unit, whiskey producer United Spirits Ltd., trades at 63 times forecast profit.Any deal will add to the $3.9 billion raised through IPOs in India this year, up from $2.2 billion during the same period in 2017, Bloomberg-compiled data show. Exact details of Carlsberg¡¯s potential India offering haven¡¯t been set yet, and there¡¯s no certainty the deliberations will lead to a transaction, the people said.A representative for Carlsberg declined to comment.Carlsberg started operations in 2007 in India, where it sells five types of beer under the Carlsberg and Tuborg brands, according to its website. It finalized the building of its eighth brewery in the country, located in the southwestern state of Karnataka, at the end of last year, according to its annual report.The company¡¯s India sales volume rose more than 30 percent in the quarter ended March from a year earlier, rebounding from a dip caused by the government¡¯s ban on alcohol sales along highways, Chief Financial Officer Heine Dalsgaard said on an analyst call last month. Carlsberg¡¯s Tuborg lagers accounted for 81 percent of its net revenue in India last year, according to its 2017 annual report.¡ª With assistance by Candice Zachariahs, and Thomas Buckley"
Elliott Taps BlackRock's Marshall to Form CLO Entity,"Elliott Management tapped BlackRock Inc.¡¯s Adrian Marshall to run a new investment entity that the hedge fund is seeding in a bid to expand into the red-hot CLO market, according to people with knowledge of the matter.Marshall, a senior bank loan money manager at New York-based BlackRock, will be joining as chief investment officer at the new entity in September, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Elmwood Asset Management was created last month with backing from Elliott, and will package riskier corporate loans into securities known as collateralized loan obligations, the people said.Paul Singer¡¯s $35 billion hedge fund has been eyeing entry into Wall Street¡¯s hottest debt market, and earlier this year enlisted GoldenTree Asset Management¡¯s Brian McNamara as a consultant to help with the effort, Bloomberg reported in April. In coming weeks, McNamara will become head of research at Elmwood, said the people. Adam Jakimo, a vice president at Telos Asset Management, will join as a research analyst, they said.Elmwood is planning to hire more people, but the timing and number of hires is yet-to-be decided. Elliott won¡¯t have a hand in the new entity¡¯s day-to-day management, the people said.A BlackRock representative confirmed Marshall will depart after helping with the transition for the credit team, which will assume his responsibilities. Stephen Spruiell, a spokesman for Elliott, declined to comment. Jakimo didn¡¯t respond to messages seeking comment.Read more: CLO Machine Approaching Full-TiltElliott¡¯s play comes as investor appetite for CLOs is reaching a fever pitch, with Wells Fargo & Co. projecting that a record $150 billion of the securities will be issued in the U.S. this year. With its stake in Elmwood, Elliott -- which already invests in CLOs -- will get a share of the market for managing the securities, alongside hedge funds including Och-Ziff Capital Management Group and King Street Capital Management.The end of so-called risk retention rules earlier this year is paving the way for new entrants into the CLO market. The regulations, designed to prevent a repeat of the subprime mortgage bond crisis, required CLO managers to hold some of the securities they were selling to investors.Other hedge funds that have issued CLOs include BlueMountain Capital Management, Anchorage Capital, Marathon Asset Management, Sound Point Capital and Telos."
Sales of Leveraged Loans Backing Buyouts are Seeing a Revival,"Sales of U.S. leveraged loans backing M&A are expected to accelerate over the next few months as private equity steps up the pace of buyouts. Investors welcome this with open arms.It¡¯s going to be a ""gangbuster"" summer, said Brendan Dillon, global co-head of leveraged finance and capital markets at UBS. ¡°Our pipeline continues to be very robust. Our peers are also very busy.""Leveraged loans for M&A and buyouts pick upData tracks issuance from Jan 1 to Jun 15
About $182 billion, or 35 percent, of all U.S. institutional loans launches so far in 2018, represent new supply, which will finance takeovers, buyouts or dividends, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time last year about $166 billion of loans, or about 28 percent, were earmarked as new deals.Private-equity firms are driving the increase in deals. The recent tax reform and improvement in corporate earnings have lowered valuations, prompting buyout shops to loosen the spigots on their substantial dry powder and to employ the leveraged loan market for financing.""The recent equity market volatility, coupled with rising rates has motivated potential sellers thus creating buying opportunities for the PE community which is sitting on an enormous amount of capital,"" said Douglas Antonacci, head of par and distressed loan sales in the global credit and special situations department, at Bank of America Corp.Among the anticipated LBO loan deals is Envision Healthcare Corp., which wants to raise about $5 billion of first-lien debt and $2 billion in junior debt. Thomson Reuters¡¯ financial and risk division is borrowing about $5.5 billion in U.S. term loans. BMC launched a $3.375 billion term loan for its buyout. And a host of smaller deals are being readied to tap loan investors.Underwriters are looking forward to the richer fees that come from providing committed financing. And loan buyers are keen, especially CLOs, which are being formed at a furious pace.""New supply has been healthy for the market, especially given the robust CLO issuance over the past 12 to 18-month time period,"" said Wayne Hosang, portfolio manager at Crescent Capital.As a result, borrowers who have gotten used to repeatedly coming back to market to slash loan margins may be left out in the cold this summer. New supply tends to put the chill on repricings.""This is something that investors are really pleased about,"" said Steven Oh, global head of credit and fixed income at PineBridge Investments, regarding the uptick in new money supply. ""It will balance the market technicals. Importantly, the new supply should lessen pressures on repricings.""If all the supply comes to market at the same time, there could even be a bit of market indigestion. Most of the buyout financings are poised to clear given strong demand from CLOs and mutual funds -- but some may have to pay a bit more.U.S. leveraged loan prices have been relatively resilient through most of 2018 -- even in the face of volatility in high-yield bonds and equities -- but there was some weakening in May when a batch of new money loans came to market. A flurry of new money issuance in July or August may cause the market to widen.""As investors reduce their position to make room for more attractive primary issuance, that could cause secondary prices of loans that are trading above par to drop closer to par,"" said Oh.The summer should be hot, but autumn may not bring a shift.""There is no reason to think this won¡¯t continue into the third quarter,"" said Dillon of UBS.¡ª With assistance by Lara Wieczezynski, and Jeannine Amodeo"
Embraer Jumps With Boeing Deal Talks in Final Stage,"Embraer SA jumped the most in two months as its proposed commercial-jet venture with Boeing Co. cleared a major hurdle.Brazilian President Michel Temer has endorsed the partnership in principle, said a person familiar with the discussions, a crucial step since the Brazilian government has veto power over any Embraer tie-up. The talks will potentially conclude within weeks, said a second person, who asked not be named because the discussions are private.Boeing and Embraer are getting closer to a pact that would forge the second global alliance between major airplane manufacturers. Airbus SE is set to take control July 1 of Bombardier Inc.¡¯s C Series single-aisle jetliner, a direct rival of Embraer¡¯s next generation of planes. The twin deals are set to turn the market for a new generation of 100- to 150-seat planes into the next battleground in the broader struggle between Boeing and Airbus.Embraer¡¯s American depositary receipts jumped 5.9 percent to $26.37 at the close in New York, the most in two months. Boeing was little changed at $370.62.Temer gave his blessing after Brazil¡¯s Air Force, defense minister and secretary of strategic affairs approved the deal, said the person familiar with the president¡¯s deliberations. Negotiators for Boeing and Embraer have reached agreement on most issues and are now discussing some remaining details that amount to about 10 percent of the terms, the person said.The planemakers have been crafting a commercial joint venture, to be controlled by Chicago-based Boeing, that would combine their marketing, manufacturing and engineering prowess. Embraer¡¯s defense unit, considered one of Brazil¡¯s industrial jewels, would remain a separate company.Embraer would gain clout in tamping down supplier costs, and a global sales force to help its E-Jets compete with the Airbus team touting the C Series. Boeing would gain greater access to a lower-cost manufacturing center outside the U.S., along with seasoned engineers as it marshals resources for a new mid-range airliner."
J&J; Formally Accepts $2.1 Billion Offer for Diabetes Device Unit,"Johnson & Johnson said it will move forward with the $2.1 billion sale of its diabetes monitoring unit LifeScan Inc. to Platinum Equity, a private investment firm.J&J said in March that it had received a $2.1 billion binding offer from Platinum Equity. On Tuesday, it said it had formally accepted that offer. The health-care company said it expects the deal to close by the end of the year.New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J has been selling off smaller units as the health-care conglomerate gets out of businesses where it¡¯s not a leader. Last week, it announced the sale of a sterilization division to Fortive Corp. for $2.7 billion.Medical devices and diagnostics are the second-biggest of J&J¡¯s three major areas, which also include drugs and consumer health products. LifeScan makes the OneTouch brand of diabetes monitors, and the division had $1.62 billion in sales last year."
Opendoor Raises $325 Million to Expand Homebuying to 50 Markets,"Opendoor, a startup that uses computer algorithms to buy and sell homes, has closed a new fundraising round in a bid to supercharge growth.The San Francisco-based company said Wednesday it has raised $325 million from General Atlantic LLC, Access Technology Ventures and homebuilder Lennar Corp., among other investors, to expand into 50 U.S. metropolitan areas by 2020.The company has now raised $645 million in equity capital and $1.5 billion in debt financing. The new round of financing values Opendoor at more than $2 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named because it is private.¡°Our goal is to allow people to buy and sell real estate without any friction online,¡± said Chief Executive Officer Eric Wu. ¡°That¡¯s really what the capital is going towards -- how do we start to build the future of real estate, how do we start to reinvent the experience end to end?¡±Opendoor is best known for offering owners a new way to sell homes. Instead of hiring a listing agent, they upload information about their home on Opendoor¡¯s website and receive a cash offer from the startup, usually within 48 hours. If the homeowner accepts, Opendoor makes minor repairs and puts the property on the market. In return for the convenience, sellers pay Opendoor a fee, usually 1 to 1.5 percent above what traditional real estate agents charge.The company is currently buying homes at a rate of $2.5 billion a year across 10 metros and gearing up to offer mortgages and title services to buyers. In Phoenix, one of the company¡¯s more mature markets, Opendoor is the buyer in about 3 percent of home resales, according to Michael Orr, publisher of the Cromford Report, which provides data on the local housing market. That figure excludes new homes and the sales of certain distressed properties.Other investors in Opendoor¡¯s latest round of financing include 10100 Fund, former Uber Technologies Inc. chief executive officer Travis Kalanick¡¯s investment fund, and Invitation Homes Inc., the single-family-rental landlord that Blackstone Group LP took public last year.As it expands, Opendoor will have to grapple with the complexity of managing building contractors and sales teams in far-flung markets while preparing to sustain the business when the housing market turns. The company currently employs 650 workers -- including data scientists who specialize in valuing homes and help the company manage risk -- and plans to double its staff, Wu said.It will also have to grapple with other companies plying similar business models. Offerpad has raised more than $410 million in equity and debt financing and expects to buy and sell more than $1.5 billion of single-family homes over the next year. Zillow Group Inc., the online-listings giant, has announced its own plans to buy and sell homes in a bid to capture what CEO Spencer Rascoff has described as a potential ¡°$1 billion profit opportunity annually.¡±"
Pastor Who Made Millions Claims He Didn't Know About Hacking Scam,"Prosecutors say Vitaly Korchevsky is a savvy trader who used stolen information to make millions of dollars on the stock market. His lawyer says Korchevsky is a ¡°selfless¡± pastor who was ¡°in the dark¡± about where the information came from.Korchevsky, a former Morgan Stanley vice president and a pastor of a Slavic Evangelical Baptist Church in the Philadelphia area, is on trial in federal court in Brooklyn, New York on charges of fraud and conspiracy for his alleged role in a sweeping insider-trading scheme.Prosecutors claim that he and another trader, Vladislav Khalupsky, teamed up with Ukraine-based hackers to obtain corporate press releases before they were made public, and used them to place profitable trades. The conspiracy netted more than $20 million for the group, including $14 million for Korchevsky, according to prosecutors.Korchevsky, who is in his mid-50s, ¡°lives his life with a deep and abiding faith,¡± his lawyer Steven Brill told jurors during opening statements. He came to the U.S. at age 24 from the Soviet Union, seeking to practice his faith and make money as an ¡°earnings trader,¡± Brill said.The pastor was lured into dealing with a corrupt business man, Arkadiy Dubovoy, who didn¡¯t tell him his information came from hackers, Brill said. Korchevsky made millions of dollars, but much of it went to his flock, including purchasing homes for some members, Brill said. Dubovoy pleaded guilty in 2016 and is expected to testify for the government in the case.Prosecutors allege that Korchevsky and Khalupsky knew what they were getting into with Dubovoy and sought to make money from the stolen releases, which came from organizations such as PR Newswire Association LLC, Marketwire Holding LP and Business Wire.The traders used coded messages and ¡°a lot of different computers and phones¡± to communicate with other conspirators, Assistant U.S. Attorney David Gopstein told jurors. Korchevsky had conspirators buy him multiple cell phones, Gopstein said. Khalupsky¡¯s email was found to contain a stolen press release for software company Oracle Corp., Gopstein said.Agents collected more than 70 devices during searches in Georgia in August 2015, said Alan Davis, a U.S. Secret Service special agent who was called to the witness stand Wednesday.A picture of a note found on one of the cell phones, a Samsung Galaxy 4S, showed a hand-written email address and password prosecutors allege connect back to email accounts used in the scheme. Email-login information to another involved account was sent in a group chat from that phone in early 2015. One of the recipients was a relative of Arkadiy Dubovoy, Igor Dubovoy, who also pleaded guilty to his involvement in 2016.Versions of the stolen press releases were found in both email accounts. Most of the releases found were ¡°essentially identical¡± to those later published to the public, although a few may have been further edited before release, Secret Service special agent Katherine Pierce testified.Further evidence will include trading and bank records, emails and testimony from alleged conspirators, Gopstein said during opening statements.¡°You¡¯ll see evidence linking the hackers to the defendants¡¯ network,¡± he said.The men are accused of participating in a scam from 2011 to 2014 that involved as many as 10 traders and hackers, and represents an unusual intersection of securities fraud and cybercrime. Using as many as 150,000 press releases, they made money by trading in stock such as Panera Bread Co., Caterpillar Inc., Home Depot Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., according to prosecutors.The case has resulted in two other guilty pleas. At least two of the four are cooperating with prosecutors.Khalupsky¡¯s attorney said that like Korchevsky, the former broker-dealer was picked off as an ¡°easy target¡± by Arkadiy Dubovoy. Khalupsky ran a trading company and thought Dubovoy offered a promising business relationship, his attorney, LaKeytria Felder, told jurors. Khalupsky, a trader who lived in Brooklyn and Ukraine, also allegedly earned millions of dollars.Korchevsky, a U.S. citizen born in Ukraine, was arrested in August 2015 at his home in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania.The case is U.S. v. Korchevsky, 15-cr-000381, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn)."
Japan¡¯s New Economic Plan Puts Fiscal Discipline on Back Burner,"The Japanese Cabinet approved a new mid-term economic plan on Friday that further delays efforts to rein in debt and removes an important cap on spending.The plan for economic policy making and fiscal management for the next three years targets a primary balance surplus by fiscal 2025, five years later than the previous goal, and drops a 500 billion yen ($4.5 billion) limit on annual increases in social spending.Some economists have expressed concern about the removal of the spending cap while most see the delay in the primary surplus target as an acknowledgment of reality. Even under its most optimistic growth scenario, the Cabinet Office says it will take until 2027 until a surplus can be achieved.With an aging population that requires more public spending on medical care and pensions every year, Japan is struggling to put its finances in order. It has repeatedly pushed back the key budget target, which measures the government¡¯s fiscal position excluding interest payments on its borrowings.""The policies for controlling social spending are vague, and the degree to which they¡¯ll be effective is unclear,"" SMBC Nikko¡¯s Yoshimasa Maruyama and Koya Miyamae wrote in a note after a draft of the plan was released earlier this month.Read more about the fiscal pressures Japan is facingIn addition, the government established three additional fiscal goals to achieve by the time it crafts its next mid-term plan in 2021: halving the primary balance deficit from its 2017 level, bringing debt down to 180 to 185 percent of gross domestic product and cutting the budget deficit to within 3 percent of GDP.Despite removing the spending cap and delaying the surplus target, the plan reaffirms that Japan should go ahead with a 2 percentage point increase in the sales tax in October 2019. This would bring the tax rate to 10 percent. The government will consider policy measures to smooth out demand before and after the tax hike.The government also intends to create a new residency qualification for skilled foreign workers to begin working immediately in sectors suffering from labor shortages. It will also consider tax and budgetary measures to assist people in buying homes and cars after the sales tax increase."
Trump Wins Fight Over Tariff Power in Senate,"A GOP senator¡¯s bid to rein in President Donald Trump¡¯s tariff authority was scuttled after a Republican colleague blocked its consideration this month on the Senate floor.Senator Bob Corker needed agreement of all senators to get a vote on whether to attach his plan to an annual defense bill. But the senator leading the defense debate, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, said Tuesday he wouldn¡¯t go along because it risked holding up Pentagon funding and wasn¡¯t directly related. That shelves Corker¡¯s proposal to require presidents to get congressional approval for tariffs that are imposed on national security grounds, which Trump cited in announcing levies on steel and aluminum imports from Mexico, Canada and the European Union.John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said last week that GOP leaders were concerned the legislation would publicly air differences with Trump over trade ahead of November¡¯s elections.Trump last week met with 13 GOP senators who support free trade, seeking allies in an effort to end Corker¡¯s effort. Trump made a personal appeal not to undercut him just as he¡¯s trying to negotiate key trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement.Corker, a Tennessee lawmaker who is retiring in January, is increasingly open about his frustrations with Trump¡¯s trade and other policies. On the Senate floor, Corker accused Republicans lawmakers of being afraid to ¡°poke the bear¡± when they find themselves on the other side of the president.¡°The United States Senate, right now, on June 12, is becoming a body where, well, we¡¯ll do what we can do, but my gosh, if the president gets upset with us, then we might not be in the majority,¡± Corker said.Inhofe said he wants to see Corker¡¯s legislation advance in some other way, but that seems unlikely. Cornyn said last week the best course might be to send the idea to a committee, a process he wasn¡¯t sure would be completed this year.Authors of the legislation, which also include Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, said Trump abused the authority granted under a 1962 law by imposing tariffs on aluminum and steel imports because there isn¡¯t a genuine national security threat. They were joined on the bill by at least 10 other senators.Business groups, led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, had backed the legislation."
